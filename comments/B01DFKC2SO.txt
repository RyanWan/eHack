My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.Happy HolidaysRoy
Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, "Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees" got no result, so I tried "Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees" and she picked it up perfectly.4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  "Alexa, play 90s music", "Alexa, play indie music", and "Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds".  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great "freebie" if you're a prime member.6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to "Alexa, what's the definition of", "Alexa, how far away is", "Alexa, Wikipedia" (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask "Alexa, tell me more").  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).Suggestions for Improvement:1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like "How far away is the sun" but I'd really like too see Amazon add a "search" function.2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings.
So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant
I bought an Echo Dot as my sons birthday gift one month ago and I am so glad that I did. My son loves it very much. Echo Dot is a hands-free, voice-controlled smart home device. My son usually asks Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, provide information, read audiobooks and more. But the Echo dot need to plug always and the sound is not loud enough.Unintentionally, I foundMOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker with Battery Base for Dot 2nd Generation, 20W Powerful Stereo Sound, Portable Powered Speaker with 5000mAh Power Bank (Dot sold separately)-Black. It is really a good assistant for echo dot, totally free your Dot.Pros:-No need with power cord again, I could bring Alexa with me every where I go around the house-Perfect sound, 20W superior sound, promote your Echo Dots sound-5000mAh Power bank, rechargeable battery for smartphones, MP3 players, iPad-Also I can use it as a portable sound system when connected to my mobile players device with 3.5mm Aux cable-Attractive acoustic fabric and sleek, low-profile design, seamless connectionWhat a great gift to give yourself or your friends at a great price. So I highly recommend this MOKCAO power+ speaker to all of you. Maybe you can have a try. It will give you a surprise.
I am a prime member. This was my first purchase of Echo and I gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it, haha  I purchased Echo dot for 2 reasons, 1) I had wanted the original echo but thought the near $200 price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and 2) I wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately I want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is insanely high but she has always been resistant to change.  She had no wifi in her bedroom but I resolved that when I purchased TP Link AV500 Wi Fi Range Extender, Powerline Edition which did what no other wifi extender I purchased in past could do, gave my mom's room a secure wifi connection; apparently using already existing phone lines. All I know is that she now has wifi in her room. So I got Echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool.  I easily connected Echo to TP-Link and it worked. We asked Alexa a few basic questions, We laughed a little but then I had to leave. When I returned the next day, I walked in and there was music playing (oldies but goodies) and I walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional. I asked her if everything was ok. She was in awe. She was happy. She was emotional because Alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me. The speed that Alexa found the song and played it was mind-boggling. Mom was also planning a dinner in August and needed to know what day of week it was. She would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calender in the kitchen and find the date. But this time she just asked Alexa who gave her the information in like 2 seconds lol.  TP-Link and Echo / Alexa have given my mom a whole new level of excitement, bewilderment, curiosity and wonder and we have only scratched the surface to the power of Echo. 2 more Echo dots are on the way as I type and more in the future i am sure. What a great gift to give to someone at a great price.
We bought an Echo Dot as an early Christmas gift to ourselves and we're so glad that we did.  It's a very useful gadget because there's such a wide variety of things we can ask Alexa to answer or tasks that she can do for us (eg: alarms/timers, calendar, ordering, weather).Since one of the tasks that we wanted Alexa to do for us was play music, we subscribed to Amazon's Unlimited Music Plan for the Echo Dot.  It's well worth the low monthly fee to be able to ask Alexa to play any song or album anytime, without having to buy all of them individually.Millions of songs are available through one groovy gadget (and the Unlimited Music Plan).We have the Echo Dot in our home and listen to music without any external speakers.  As far as we're concerned, the internal speaker emits a decent array of sound.  Is it as robust sounding as hooking it up to our surround system amplifier or other external speakers?  Of course not, but it does sound a lot better than most internal device speakers of similar size.  For those of you that don't like the internal speaker, you can utilize the 3.5mm or Bluetooth speaker options.If we say, Alexa, Play The Top Songs by Phil Collins... then that's exactly what she does.Keep in mind that when you ask Alexa for the "Top Songs" by a soloist or group, they may not always be your favorite songs.  A work around for that is to ask Alexa to play a particular album that contains the songs you prefer to hear.The screen-shots show you how we asked Alexa to play an album vs the top songs. In addition, they show you what we see when logged-in to the Alexa app via the Chrome web browser.FYI:  When asking Alexa to play an album that has a long title, we realized that she responds accurately when we ask for part of that title (view Elton John & Michael Jackson screen-shots).  Be sure to look at what we said to Alexa vs what the whole album title is labeled.I should mention that we did ask Alexa to search for a product, which she did along with telling us the best options and their cost.  Afterward, she asked if we wanted to buy the product.  We said yes and she placed the order for us once we gave her our confirmation code (Settings: Voice Purchasing).  We recommend setting that up so other people cannot place orders without your consent.  It's convenient for us to have voice purchasing enabled when we're "unplugged" at night (except for Alexa).The skill that we use the most is Weather Sky, it gives us a detailed weather report that we use several times each day.At the time of this review, we haven't used any of the smart home features, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.PLEASE NOTE:  We purchased the Echo Dot at its listed price, we did not receive any discount to post this review.
Whether you just want the weather, latest sports scores or help with a math problem, Alexa will help. We now have 3 in the house and will be adding two more. With a simple $3 subscription to Amazon's music service, you can stream almost any music you can think of by simply asking Alexa for it!Perfect work with my meidong QQ Chocolate bluetooth speaker, I also recommend this speakerMeidong Universal Water Resistance QQChocolate Portable V4.0 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 10W Dual Driver and Built-in MicrophoneAnd use this code for less $5: GHAQE5YF(I got it from somewhere else.)For the paranoid - this device is NOT for you. The echo dot is always listening and while the design is supposed to only listen when you say the name of the device (Alexa, Amazon or Echo - your choice), there are enough times that I hear one in another room say "sorry, I did not understand the question" to tell me it misunderstands these prompts to have been said when they weren't pretty often.+ Good product support+ Good voice recognition+ Because of the size it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb in a room- Doesn't differentiate between voices. If you keep it closer to a speaker than you are, then it will sometimes get confused and start picking up words from both the speaker and you when commands are given. Placement of dot is crucial for a good experience.- Only supports english and german for now- Not very competent at answering general questions and you need to activate skills to expand this functionality. This makes asking question less intuitive since you then need to use commands like "Alexa, ask wikipedia...."- If you have smarthome devices named the same as internal functions, it will get confused at times. This may require renaming of the smarthome devices.
Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say "alexa" and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.  We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its "multi-room voice recognition" technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word "alexa" on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a "multi-device" plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited  The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.  At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is "alexa turn on the lights" and our downstairs lights spring into action.  My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with "sorry I didn't get that"Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.  Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your "free" music.  I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up "New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing" under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.  I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device.
NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it.
My Amazon Echo Dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth. I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part. The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times. This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times. I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed.
My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.Happy HolidaysRoy

With a simple $3 subscription to Amazon's music service, you can stream almost any music you can think of by simply asking Alexa for it!Perfect work with my meidong QQ Chocolate bluetooth speaker, I also recommend this speakerMeidong Universal Water Resistance QQChocolate Portable V4.0 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 10W Dual Driver and Built-in MicrophoneAnd use this code for less $5: GHAQE5YF(I got it from somewhere else.)For the paranoid - this device is NOT for you. The echo dot is always listening and while the design is supposed to only listen when you say the name of the device (Alexa, Amazon or Echo - your choice), there are enough times that I hear one in another room say "sorry, I did not understand the question" to tell me it misunderstands these prompts to have been said when they weren't pretty often.+ Good product support+ Good voice recognition+ Because of the size it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb in a room- Doesn't differentiate between voices. If you keep it closer to a speaker than you are, then it will sometimes get confused and start picking up words from both the speaker and you when commands are given. Placement of dot is crucial for a good experience.- Only supports english and german for now- Not very competent at answering general questions and you need to activate skills to expand this functionality. This makes asking question less intuitive since you then need to use commands like "Alexa, ask wikipedia...."- If you have smarthome devices named the same as internal functions, it will get confused at times. This may require renaming of the smarthome devices.
Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say "alexa" and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.  We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its "multi-room voice recognition" technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word "alexa" on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a "multi-device" plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited  The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.  At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is "alexa turn on the lights" and our downstairs lights spring into action.  My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with "sorry I didn't get that"Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.  Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your "free" music.  I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up "New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing" under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.  I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device.
NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it.
My Amazon Echo Dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth. I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part. The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times. This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times. I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed.
I decided my bathroom needed anEcho Dot (2nd Generation) - Blackso I could call up songs and news with wet hands while shaving etc. but I didn't want it to get in the way.  I found thiseBoot Solid Metal Wall Mount Stand Holder Stand Bracket for Amazon All-New Echo Dot 2nd Generation (Black)and it did the job perfectly.  I paired it with aSlimSocket+ 2.1A - Easy-Outlet-USB-Upgrade: SOLVED! - Dual USB Charging Portsand aienza Short (8-inch) USB to Micro USB Cable for Samsung Galaxy, Android Smartphones and Tablets, Kindle Fire, Fire Stick, Roku, Chromecast, Portable Speakers, Power Banks and Other Electronic DevicesReally enjoying having this on the wall, always powered and ready to go no matter what I'm doing in there.
I think she is a cutie. She is quick on the answers too. This is really a change for an older person.
I gave the Echo Dot just one star because it stopped working after 5 months.  I called customer service and was told the unit was out of warranty.  I really loved the Dot when it was working but am very disappointed that I was not offered a free replacement.  I spent $49 on this equipment and would expect it to last much longer than that.  I refused the first offer from customer service for 15% off a new one and the second offer of $20 off if I ordered one then.  If it is going to last only 5 months it becomes rather expensive.  Disappointed in Amazon that they didn't make this right.  I have been extremely happy with Amazon until this incident.Update:  Just a couple hours after I posted this review I received a call from Amazon. I was told that they could not replace the device but that my money would be refunded. I am totally impressed with Amazons customer service. Thank you. I will be purchasing another Echo Dot because I did love it.
This was a Christmas gift from a member of my family. I generally use Siri on my iPhone and MaCintosh computers, so this concept was not new to me. I don't like the Echo Dot for several reasons. When I ask Siri to play some music for me, it looks in my music collection and plays it. When I ask Alexa to play some music for me, it tries to sell me a subscription service. Most of the useful things the Dot claims to be useful for involve spending more money at Amazon.com. This is not an appliance, it is a selling machine. It is also inconvenient that it has to be plugged in somewhere to be used. I can get the same benefits from Siri on my phone without having to plug it into the wall to use. I am also tired of emails regarding all the stuff I should be able to do if only i wanted to know how far it is to Canberra or how many books there are in the Library of Congress. It's still plugged in, but we haven't spoken to one another for several weeks. Would you like it back?
I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore  . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household , and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me . Please vote my review up if you liked it.
Decided that it worked so well that it needed and stylish makeover. So I secured it on an old radio box and the wooden box make the speakers so much more vibrant and the box I have lets me have all the buttons.
There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo "skills" that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the "skills" not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached.
I purchased two Echo plus and one Echo Dot within the last month. A few days ago all Echo devices started to have a problem simultaneously: Alexa announces a new reminder (that was placed in the last few days) FOUR times (normally twice). I spent over an hour with two customer service people both of whom had no idea how to fix the problem. One of whom apparently did not know what a reminder tab of the Alexa desktop app looks like. The other started to Google the problem although I had told her I Googled it myself already before contacting Amazon. Since both of them were clueless as to how to approach the issue, I asked to speak with a more knowledgeable tech support rep but they denied my request.Since this is clearly a software issue affecting all of my Echo devices under a single Alexa account, I prefer not to factory reset all devices (I have many routines set up and smart devices connected) and frankly I do not believe that will solve the problem. For now I tell Alexa to stop before she repeats the announcement four times. In the meantime, I hope that Amazon will fix this type of software bug as soon as it arises and offer more knowledgeable tech support people to customers. Previously I posted a five-star rating and a positive review under Echo Pus. I edited my original Echo Plus review and reduced the star rating, but Amazon has not published my edit. If Amazon really strives for the best customer service, they have room for improvement.
Very useful, but a great "toy" also.  I use it in my bedroom to set an alarm, play radio and music, and even installed a skill that meows at my cat (she loves it!).  Will set up my smart plug so I can turn on and off the light when I get a chance.  I love finally having music in my bedroom without having to haul in a boom box.  Amazing sound, too!UPDATE: I purchased a Show and moved the Dot to my bedroom.  It seems to have slowly lost its sensitivity to my voice.  It can no longer hear me say Alexa unless I am within 3 feet of it.  Of course, now I am 2 days out of warranty.  I would NOT buy this again
I was concerned about the lack of security when I saw the 'not a secure network' tag while trying to set it up. That actually was no problem as I have never been able to get it set up completely -- even with the help of a 'young person.'  I did get it to engage once, but then it kicked off my home wi fi network. Seeing all the comments re an unsecured network, I would advise people stay far away from this device. Luckily, I bought this one when it was on sale, so my monetary loss isn't quite as much as it would have been if I had bought it today.
Just recieved my Echo Dot a few days ago as a graduation gift and it has been truly life changing! This is the all-in-one solution I have been looking for my old Sony G Box. Prior to this I was using Chromecast audio and a Bluetooth adapter that fit on top of the iPod dock using the old apple standard so I would have to constantly walk up to the box and switch between Bluetooth and castiing which took up a lot of time. The reason I did this was because I like to stream from multiple music services like Apple Music and Spotify but you could only listen over wifi with Spotify because Apple Music doesn't support it.Echo Dot has Bluetooth built in so I can seamlessly switch to services (like Apple Music) that don't support wifi streaming with just a simple voice command!Speaking of voice commands so far Alexa has been able to understand me most of the time and it's been really convient. You do have to give up some privacy with the voice commands but there is a switch on the device to turn the mic off which is nice.My only issue is not with the device itself but with the Alexa app. Amazon needs more developers to work on it to make it more intuitive and faster. Right now the app feels clunky and slow. If Amazon can fix this issue than it will be perfect. I'm still giving a five star rating because the device is just so good.
I purchased this device and started using it to play music. Most of the time, when I ask for Alexa to play a specific artist, it plays something else. Or says that it will shuffle songs by that artist and just plays one and then goes quiet. Then, I decided to connect my phone and play music from my own device and that works fine, but defeats the purpose of having the Echo device. Later, it started playing the ads that come whenever I am playing a game on my phone, even though I had disconnected from the device. It is really annoying when it does that. So far, I am really dissatisfied with this product. I thought I was going to really enjoy the benefits of having unlimited music, but it just doesn't play what I want. The other day wanted to play cheerful music and I said: "Alexa, play lively music, please". She responded: "Now shuffling Blues songs." It has happened a few more times when I ask for the device to play other types of music. I am not not happy at all.
I bought this because I thought it would be kind of neat, but where this really shines for the average person without a smart home is in the kitchen. Whether its setting timers, asking for conversions, or adding something to my shopping list as soon as I see we need more, its one of those things that youre not sure how you ever lived without.The shopping list can be accessed remotely by anyone in your household, so whenever we go shopping its super easy.
The Echo Dot stopped working within 48 hours. Says it can't connect to the Wi-Fi, and can't get it to reset. Every other wi-fi device we have in the home continues to work fine. So have to send it back for a refund and try another unit. Also, the Echo Dot device is very limited in responses, and most of the time, Alexa says, "I don't have that answer." The Echo Dot Alexa is good for weather reports or listening to music and other basic skills. Fun item, but very frustrating at times. Amazon and the Alexa staff need to refine the technology of these devices. Hopefully the 2nd Echo Dot works better, otherwise, I will have to report it is a piece of technology "junk". I hope not.Ordered 2nd Echo Dot....same problem will not connect to wifi and all order devices in the house function properly on wi-fi. This is junk and not worth the frustration.
I LOVE my amazon Alexa. She is entertaining and funny. She is so helpful, and can do so many things. Here are a few to try:Tell my a jokeSing me a songWhat do you think of Siri?Merry ChrismasHow old are you?My only complaint is that sometimes it is hard to connect it to the WiFi. Also, it takes a couple minutes to turn on after it has been unplugged.Overall, I am happy with my Alexa.I suggest the dot over the version with a built in speaker because you can buy an additional speaker for your dot for less money.
What a fantastic device this is!  I bought one on Amazon Prime Day, so I have only had it hooked up for a couple of days.  I love it so much, though, that I ordered a second one so I don't have to keep moving it around.  I also ordered an external speaker (via Amazon, of course) for the one I'll keep in the living/dining/kitchen area.There are so many fantastic reviews on the Echo Dot that I won't reinvent the wheel; instead, I will just address some questions that I still had even after reading reviews and etc. and hope you find it useful.Setup really IS a breeze.  I am technologically-challenged, so I was a bit worried about this aspect of it.  If you can download an app and read, you won't have any trouble.  That said, I DID have some trouble initially because I was using my laptop, and the setup process kept getting stuck at connecting to the internet (she'd connect, but in the process, I lost my own connection).  I did spend time trying to look for a solution but eventually gave up and downloaded the Amazon Alexa app to my Kindle Fire.  Despite its poor ratings (I think it has only 3 stars, mostly because it doesn't appear to have been updated in quite some time), I found using the app to get the Dot up and running was easy-peasey and very fast (less than two minutes).  Just follow the setup instructions, and Alexa does all the work (you do have to enter your wifi password, though, so have that handy).You do NOT have to have skills for Alexa to function. Skills are those add-on things that everyone's talking about that are like little programs you can open to do different things, sort of like "tools" on your phone or "calculator" and "stickies" (etc.) on your computer.  I'm only adding that because I wasn't clear about that just from reading about them, and they sounded confusing (more on this in a bit).Without skills added, she is remarkable.  To start, just say, "Alexa" and then whatever else, and she will tell you.  She'll tell you the weather, the time, get any information you can think of (from Wikipedia), tell you about local stores (including hours, distance, and whether or not they are open when you ask--you do need to allow her to access your location via the app), tell you what day Christmas (or whatever) falls on in any given year, add things to your shopping list (accessible via the app, including off-line if using a tablet as I am), shop via Amazon (just say, Alexa, how much is [product]?  She'll look it up and tell you, including different options, and then she'll ask if you want to buy it.  Or Alexa, buy [blah]).  And she will:  tell you a story, sing you a song, read your news (she's preset to a briefing but you can change it to Fox or Reuters or NPR, etc. in the app), play any song via Amazon Music (I do not have a sub to the pay Amazon music, just regular Prime), tell you when sunrise and sunset are, and probably a zillion other things that I can't remember or haven't tried.To get anything to happen, just say "Alexa," and then whatever you want to happen.WITHOUT skills added, Alexa does SO MUCH:  Some of my favorites already are the stuff you wonder or would like throughout the day (the time, the temperature, the weather, the news, timers, reminders, whatever), and for fun, I love the following:"Alexa, sing me a song" She'll sing "Take me out to the ballpark," some original material about how helpful she is (HILARIOUS), and a bunch of others."Alexa, tell me a story" She'll tell you a quick little story, so far the ones she's told me are "clean" (i.e. appropriate for households with children) and quite sweet."Alexa, tell me a joke"  She'll tell you a quick little joke, some are groaners, but so far, they're all at least cute and fun."Alexa, what's your favorite movie"  She'll tell you and add a quick little blurb about why she likes it.She'll also set up an alarm for you without a skill.  Just say, "Alexa, set an alarm."  Ditto for reminders:  I said "Alexa set a reminder for Monday," and she asked what time and what the reminder is for, so I just told her, and voila! Instant reminder to take the trash out.Another concern I had was whether or not I had to remember a bunch of commands, but it turns out, you don't have to be so picky about what you say when not using skills, just say what you think makes sense, and she'll usually get it.  If she doesn't just rephrase it.For example, I asked her "Alexa, who starred in The Rifleman," but she said she didn't know.  So I said, "Alexa, wikipedia, The Rifleman," and she told me about it, including the star of it (Chuck Conners).  The initial blurb is short (less than 30 seconds), but she will ask if you want to know more (at which point, say "Alexa, tell me more" if you want more, or nothing, if you don't).I was initially worried that it would be too confusing to dive into skills and things I'd never heard of before, so I was relieved that she does so much without skills.  That said, skills are definitely fun:  I've added Jeopardy (Alexa, play Jeopardy) and Sleep Sounds (a great skill with a bunch of soothing sounds like rain, thunderstorm, ocean, and many more.  They loop, so until you tell her to stop, she will keep playing them (I tell her to stop when I wake up).  I also added this day in History (Alexa, tell me what happened on this day), Inspire me (Alexa, inspire me; she'll play you a random inspirational quote--so far, they are recordings not in her voice), and quite a few more.Most skills appear to be pretty picky about what you have to say to get it started, but the skill description provides the term to use to start it, and you can review your skills via the app).  Remembering this stuff is not my strong suit, so I have to look in the app to remember what skill words are correct and will get the desired result.  As with anything, the more I use it, the more I will remember.  And I'm sure that skills will fall by the wayside as I either forget the correct phrase or quit caring about it.The Alexa app is pretty intuitive, and the menu is good, helping to find specific things you want to know.  I do wish it had a "home" button you can click at any time because it's a pain to have to page back to it (or quit the app and restart it).You do not have to be right on top of her or even facing her for her to "hear" you. Just speak in your normal speaking voice.  I have her in my living room, adjacent to my dining/kitchen area, and I said "Alexa, add pickles to my shopping list."  My back was to her, and I was foraging in the fridge at the time, and she heard me perfectly and added pickles to my shopping list.That said, I've found that some skills mess with her "hearing," and that you have to yell in her direction to get them to stop (I deleted these immediately; who wants to stand around yelling at a hockey puck-looking object?).You can unplug the Dot and move it to another room, she'll just start up again on her own once plugged back in, including keeping all reminders and timers you've set.Dot cannot work without wifi, so it doesn't really matter that she doesn't have a battery pack in that sense.  But there is no way to move her to a place where she cannot be plugged in and still have access to wifi.Security:  She is always listening.  Always.  To stop this, you can mute her (button on top of Dot) or just unplug her to be doubly sure. She doesn't record anything you say unless you say "Alexa" first (or "Amazon" or "Echo" depending on what you prefer, I stuck with "Alexa" which she comes programmed to answer), but she will record anything you say after that even if she has no idea what you are talking about.  You can manage these recordings via the app.Alexa calling:  this does NOT work unless you have the app on your phone AND enable access to your entire contacts list.  This is unfortunate and will hopefully be fixed at some point so that you can give only those contacts you intend to actually contact or wish to be contacted by via Alexa.  That said, if you are so inclined, you can enable access and then go though via the app and block everyone you don't want calling/messaging you if they have Alexa (or the app).  This is still too intrusive to me, so I'm not doing it.I think that's all the questions I still had before purchasing the Dot and hope it helps.  If you are even thinking about getting this, I say, go for it.  You will be pleasantly surprised by how functional she is before you add even one skill.________________UPDATE: 10/31/2017I just saw that you can save $10 on a one-day deal on Echo dot.  Buy one.  Even if you aren't sure, for $40 what do you have to lose?Since I wrote my initial review, I have grown to love the Echo dot more than ever.  My latest favorite thing is saying, "Alexa, good morning."  She'll give you some fun fact or random observation about the day in question.I set timers, alarms, and reminders all the time, and she never fails (well, barring a power or internet outage).  She will tell you the weather and when sunset and sunrise are.  She'll cheer you up with a silly joke or inspirational message, and she'll tell you how many tablespoons equal one cup, she'll do whatever math you ask her, and she'll tell you if your apples are bad.The only downside that I can see is that the calling feature is still far too intrusive.  Amazon doesn't need to know every contact I have; they need only those contacts I will contact via Alexa.  When that happens, my happiness with this device will be complete.
Unlike Google, Amazon provides an AI device option called the Amazon Echo Dot that allows those of us with vintage or antique radios to get some more use and enjoyment out of them.  The Amazon Echo Dot easily connects to any old radio that features an original RCA input or has been modified to accept RCA or a Mini plug.  This transforms old AM and shortwave radios that you can barely find stations on anymore, into vibrant jukeboxes.  Merging warm analog tube audio with a modern array of on-demand content is a killer combination!  I can now listen to old radio shows on my old radio."Alexa, open radio Suspense", "Alexa, play the original broadcast of War of the Worlds by Orsen Wells".  I can listen to music made when my radio was.  "Alexa, play music from the 1930's".One of my antique tube radios is a 1938 Zenith 7s363, the same model featured in the movie Night of the Living Dead.  "Alexa, play the soundtrack for Night of the Living Dead."  I can hear the movie through the radio in the movie!  AMAZING!Dust off your antique radio and get a Dot, you won't be disappointed!
So amazing that I bought a second after having the first for a week!  The Echo Dot is a smaller version of the Echo.  It's small, but mighty and the extra pair of hands every mom has been craving for.  Basically the Dot is a computer that you talk to.  It's slightly larger than a can of tuna.  The Dot has a name.  Her name is Alexa, but you can change the name to whatever works best for you.  You simply say, "Alexa" and then ask/tell it to do your bidding.  What can she do?Alexa can:Set multiple timers at onceSet multiple remindersAdd things to your calendarTell you time, date, and the weatherSet alarmsPlay music from Amazon Prime, Pandora, or Sirius XMTell you the news (local, national, or international)Play radio stations from around the country or the worldWalk you through recipes while cookingCreate shopping lists for when you go to the grocery storeOrder products from AmazonAdd products to your Amazon shopping cartTell you what is in your shopping cart and order themTurn on/off lights (if you have the smart bulbs)Tell you the traffic for your daily commuteand much much more!The possibilities are endless.  I have found getting ready in morning to be easier with the Dot.  I don't have to stop and look up the weather.  If I need the time, I don't have to find my watch or go into the next room for a clock.  I'll know if my regular commute is open or if I need to take an alternative route.  Cooking has been less frantic because I just set the multiple timers and I do not have to remember how much time in on the 45 minutes for the ham that I need to take the casserole out.  I set the reminders and she just tells me.  If want an update on my Amazon purchases, then it's there I do not have to look it up.  If I added something to my cart, but forgot to purchase it I can ask Alexa to complete the order.  You can play games and you can ask it random questions like How many Super Bowl Rings do the Pittsburgh Steelers have?  Or Who was Martin Luther King, Jr.?  What is Stargazy Pie?Downsides? Hardly any, but consider this:  The Echo Dot is not made for an awesome stereo listening experience.  You can link up bluetooth speakers to it, but while I would say the speaker is great for a bedroom or a kitchen, this is not for your living room/game room/family room.  I would advise to get the regular Echo for that.  You can link multiple Dots together as well as link a Dot to an Echo, so if you're looking for really good sound that may be the way to go.  Also, when I cheerfully tell friends that I have a Dot they retort that it's a listening device and Amazon or the government is listening in on my conversations.  They are not.  However, if you are really worried, two things, you can turn the microphone off and then Alexa can't "hear" anything or you can unplug the Dot completely.  The Echos must be plugged in at all times for them to work.  So if you are worried about Amazon executives listening to you while you sleep you can just unplug the entire device when you are not using it.  Problem solved.  Although no one is actually listening, and if your house is like mine, it's mostly just screaming kids so listen away!Bottomline:  You will not be disappointed!
We loved our Echo dot when it was working. We used it for our alarms, music, and general weather and news. The product was responsive and worked wonderfully, staying in the same spot for a year. No drops, no power outages, no surges, no issues whatsoever. We ordered the echo dot in November 2016 and opened the package and began use in January of 2017. In January of 2018 the dot stopped working. we called Amazon and support suggested a new adapter- unfortunately, that did not work and we were told that was all they could do, we were outside warranty. I expect a product to work and last longer than one year, I am disappointed with the durability of this product.
I bought three of these last year - kept one and gave two as Christmas gifts.  I also have an Echo (1st gen) and two more Dots (1st gen).  Yesterday, I deregistered every last one of the Dots and they're going on ebay.  Still deciding if the mothership Echo is staying or going.  May keep it for music.  What I have discovered this week is, if you need to change your wifi, you can have a problem.  I had to install a new wifi and unfortunately, seems there is no way to delete the Wemo plugs from the Alexa Smart Home section of the app.  The plugs can be disabled but never deleted.  I checked this out through Echo Help and searched it online.  I was able to reconnect some of them, through trial and error, but they no longer work reliably.  That's a serious programming deficiency by Amazon and Belkin (makers of Wemo plugs) and huge annoyance.  BTW, on the Wemo app from Playstore, I can't even disable the plugs.  Anyway, after stewing about this for two days, I was going to invest in TPLink smart plugs for my Echos but discovered a Google Smart Home Mini is cheaper than a plug. I'll use my expensive collection of Wemo plugs on a couple of those instead.  Soooo, "Alexa, say bye-bye."If anyone know how to delete a Wemo device from the Alexa app, please share, and I'll try again.
This works much like the other Echo devises.  It gets the job done and if you purchase at the holiday prices it is a pretty good deal.  I also have the Echo Show, which has a much better sound compared to the Echo Dot.If you are looking to explore this type of device, where you ask it things and it response with useful information, this would be an economical way to start.  Hookup is fairly simple.  It took me all of about 5 minutes including the Alexa phone app you need to download to help set this unit up.  You will also need wifi and your wifi password to complete installation.I ordered the white Echo Dot (2nd Generation).  I was disappointed that my unit, even though it was ordered in white, the wall adapter and cord are black.  I was expecting a white unit with a white power supply and white cord.  Not black.  I'm going to contact Amazon to find out if they could ship me the proper colored wall unit an plug.  This is the reason I could only give it 3 stars.  Sorry.Update, I talked with tech support.  It seems the only power supplies and cords they offer are black.  So, if cord color is important to you, you too might be disappointed. I believe that Amazon should clearly state this somewhere, though they don't.
I like the idea behind the Dot as I'm 49 years old and having someone tell me what I know I could just read appeals to me.  However, the one thing that I was excited about was being able to hear what my schedule was for the next day or week.  I use an iPhone 7+ and I use the Apple calendar paired with my Microsoft Outlook at my desktop in the office and that calendar is shared with my assistant.  It cost me $150 to get that hooked up to where my Dot can read me my calendar but I still can't have Dot add appointments.  It took my computer guy almost 1.5 hours to set this up through the exchange account that we use.  He's very good and he's about 30 so he knows his stuff.  He just said that it was difficult because you're limited on your options to pair with the Dot and he had to do a workaround.  With that being said, I like the Dot but beware if you have a complicated exchange system like the one that I use.  You may not be able to sync it yourself and you may need outside help at an additional cost.
EDIT after another few days of use.  Drops WiFi way too much!  How many times do I need to repeat the WiFi setup process?  Power cycling the Dot and the router doesn't help.  I find I have to repeat the WiFi setup from scratch.  Happens on all three second-gen Dots I have.  (Don't have any first-gen Dots.)No other device in the home (laptops, Macbooks, desktops, TVs, Xbox, PS3, PS4, Roku, Apple TV, iPhones, Android phones, tablets, even a couple of IOT devices), NONE! has any troubles whatsoever staying connected to WiFi.  Except the Dots.  Google it.  LOTS of frustrated users.Good Lord, Amazon, fix the damn Dot software!------------------------I have a very fast, stable home WiFi network with a strong signal.  It runs many devices with no issues whatsoever.My first Dot was working well, so I bought two second gen Dots. At first the new Dots could not hold WiFi connections for more than a few minutes!  I was tearing my hair out, and getting ready to return both of them.On a hunch, I rebooted the router and power cycled the Dots.  Now they seem to work pretty well.Touchy technology!And on another subject, the "calling / drop-in" feature really needs some further refinement. For example, I can't find a way to tell Amazon's network that I do not wish to receive calls on the Alexa app on my iPhone.
Was never able to connect this to WiFi via Android Alexa app.  I could connect to the device over WiFi and I could connect to my home's WiFi but it would never allow me to connect the device to my WiFi.  It stays on a blank "Setup" screen and never gets to the point where it displays available WiFi and allows me to enter my password.  Did factory reset - no change.  Deleted and reinstalled the app - no change.  Powered down my phone and powered it back up - no change.  Almost no documentation with device or online.  Youtube videos show users getting the WiFi display and Amazon "help" says to pick the settings then WiFi option but there is no WiFi option under settings - just says my device isn't set up.  Try to set it up again and repeats the same process being stuck at blank "Setup" screen forever.  There's mention in Amazon "help" about saving your WiFi password on Amazon but there's no place on their website to do so or in the Alexa app.  Total piece of crap.
I have bought two Echos one for my daughter and one for my son, so when the Echo Dot (2nd generation) came out I thought why not. Both my kids have been trying to talk me into getting one, so I opted for the smaller Echo Dot.The box included the black Amazon Echo Dot, power adapter/cable (6 ft.), and quick start guide. The dimensions are 1.3" x 3.3" x 3.3" and it weighs 5.7 oz., it resembles a hockey puck. When hooked up it plays all your music from Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and more using just your voice and you dont even have to be near it. It allows hands-free convenience with voice-control. Just ask Alexia the weather for the day, a joke, question, reads audio books, turns on/off lights, the tv, make a to-do list and the list goes on and on. All you do is plug in the Echo, connect to the internet with the Alexia app and thats it. It is not as loud as the original Echo but it can also connect to your speakers or headphones over Bluetooth or through a 3.5 mm audio cable (not included) to deliver stereo sound to the speakers you choose. That is a nice feature and I have connected to my Bose soundlink and the sound and volume is amazing.My Mom loves it when she comes over and really would like to get one but she does not have internet. Overall I am very pleased with the Echo Dot and learning new things everyday
These things sounded neat. The different things they could do offered up a lot of interest. The main thing I that got my attention is the intercom function. I bought them feeling that if I didn't have to yell across the house to get my kids attention it would be great. My kids now come to the sound of me yelling at alexa because its worthless. I can be right in front of it and it doesn't hear correctly. It often disconnects and half the time it stops working so you have to go in to some stupid account settings. If this is what you want to call "smart tech" you're obviously on the same level. I would not buy again. These are going the same place as my fire tv products that stopped supporting youtube because of this trash company.
Has good features when it works.
So, I moved into my new place and was wondering first how to eliminate all the remotes for my tv. Just bought a new Samsung TV, then have my Cable service and my home theater system all set up. So many remotes! I was researching on how to eliminate them and stumbled across the Logitech Harmony that would work with Alexa. "What was Alexa?" I asked myself. Started doing more research and found out that she could make your home into a "Smart Home". Needless to say, 3 dots later and several Wifi Lights and Light Switches later as well as the Harmony Hub, my home is now hands free! I can tell Alexa to turn on the TV, and BAM! Everything is on that I need. I can lie in bed after a long day and have no need to turn down the A/C or even turn off my lights. Alexa does it all for me! I love it! And I'm always searching for new ways to see what Alexa can control!
I purchased an Echo and and a Dot about a year ago during Black Friday and have added to the collection since. I got my first devices soon after getting out a lengthy hospital stay. My surgery had been challenging and I was pretty much bed-ridden for eight weeks afterward. Needless to say I was miserable due to being bed-ridden and my inability to hardly walk or care for myself.I had previously been somewhat familiar with the Echo and Dot, but had never taken the plunge. I decided to get my first two devices shortly after discovering Audible and seeing that the Echo products, Audible and TuneIn were compatible. The Black Friday discounts were pretty enticing as well and given my health at the time and lack of anyone to help me compelled me to make the plunge. In hindsight, the product combination, capability and timing was a Godsend for me. In combination they helped me make through a difficult and challenging period. Alexa allowed me to control my lights, music, check the news and weather, listen to TuneIn, Pandora, set alarms, medical reminders and timers, listen to books via Audible, and even tell me good morning and good night all from my bed.In terms of sound quality, the Echo is hands down substantially better than the Dot, but I compensated the shortcomings of the Dot's speaker by pairing it with a JBL Charge speaker that I had gotten for my recovery ahead of time.Fast forwarding, my Alexa Eco system has grown in combination with my overall home automation. Overall, I think the Dot and the rest of the Alexa ecosystem are awesome (see my review on the Fire TV 4K Ultra for what else you can do from a video perspective), especially when it comes to home automation and control. In terms of sound and responsiveness, the Dot is not as good as the Echo. The Dot's sound quality is understandable. However, the Dot's responsiveness is not as good as the Echo which surprised me.The sound quality of the Dot can be addressed by using external Bluetooth or powered speakers with an analogue input as I mentioned previously. Or if you happen to have Sonos speakers, then sound quality is a non issue since you'll use the Sonos speakers in either case. However, in terms of responsiveness, the Dot definitely underperforms compared to the Echo. I find myself having to sometimes repeat myself to the Dot, especially if music is playing.  However, this has never been an issue with the Echo.If you don't have external speakers and you plan to use for listening to music, then definitely pay the extra to go with the Echo. The sound quality is substantially better with the Echo. The Dot is still a great product if you're not going to use for listening to music or if you already have external speakers you can use with it. A fun Alexa capability if you happen to have multiple devices and want to listen to the same music in multiple locations in your home then you can use the Alexa app to set that up. I really like this capability and find myself using this option frequently.Where the Dot and Echo come up short in my opinion, is if you try to address things in a more conversational manner or to answer questions. Neither product does very well in this area, they actually do pretty poorly. Whereas the Google Home and Mini excel in this. The Home and the Mini seem to be able to keep up fairly well in conversations and will quote various web sources in answering the question. I can start a conversation for example about a certain country and have a reasonable conversation with a Google Home or Mini device without having to invoke the wakeup phrase each time. I can't do this with the Dot or Echo. I can also access songs and other content from YouTube using the Home or Mini and use Chromecast to cast it to another device. Neither of which can I do with the Dot or Echo. YouTube access is huge for me, I wish Amazon would play nice with Google and allow each other's devices access to one another's content. I have to admit, despite that I am a huge Alexa fan, I really like the Google devices and their ability. However at the same time it get's very annoying and sterile having to say "Hey Google" over and over again. "Alexa" is so much more pleasant. Additionally, the Google devices do not currently work with Sonos whereas the Dot and Echo do. I am not sure if Sonos/Google integration will ever occur, especially now that Google has introduced it's own Sonos-like speaker.So which do you choose if you're just starting out? I would say it depends on a number of factors. If you have a preference for one or the either's Eco system, then let that be your guide. If you want to have somewhat of a conversation, get nswers to questions or listen to a lot of YouTube content and you don't mind saying "Hey Google" over and over again, then I would recommend either the Google Home or Mini. If you're going the Google route, then I would skip the Home and go with the Mini personally and pair it up with one of the Chromecast devices and some low cost (or better) speakers. The Google Home and Mini are pretty good for home automation use, but the Echo and Dot still have them beat in that area (although the gap is starting to close). I should mention, at least at the time of this writing, Alexa has some periodic problems with Hue lights. You can ask Alexa to turn on a particular device and she may turn on all of your Hue devices which can be frustrating if you didn't want them all on. The problem is absent from the Google devices.If you already have, or plan or getting Sonos speakers, then go with the Dot. Although if you're considering the Sonos 5, you may want to compare it to the Google Home Max which is $100 cheaper although not as functional yet. If you just want to listen to Audible content, newscast and sports then you could get by with the Dot alone, but I would recommend that you jump to the Echo. I really wouldn't recommend the Dot as a standalone unit. It's better if you already have some overall use in mind such as controlling your lights in which it would work nicely. Don't get me wrong, the Dot is a great little device, but not as a standalone unit in my opinion.If you're on a limited budget and you're starting from ground zero, go with the Dot and purchase a low cost, compatible speaker to go with it. The Google Mini doesn't have an analog port like the Dot does, but you can pair both devices with Bluetooth capable speakers. Despite the limitations in the conversational area, there's a large number of Apps and products that already work with the Dot and Alexa - plus you don't have to say "Hey Google" all the time ( ;-) maybe it's just me that's bothered by this - I really wish Google would change this). If you have the money, but not sure which direction to go in or want the best of what's available from each ecosystem, then get a Dot, a Google Mini, a Sonos Play 1 and one of the Chromecast devices and figure out how you want to grow from there.Light Ring Status Meanings:I thought I should also mention something about the light ring status indicators as they can sometimes be a bit confusing and the Alexa app does a poor job of communicating what they mean. You can find light ring meaning if you check Amazon Device Support   Echo Help  Getting Started with Echo on the Amazon site or check in my review below:* Pulsing yellow light - A message or notification is waiting for you. Say, "Play my messages" or "What did I miss?" To learn more go to About Alexa Messaging at the site I mentioned above.* Pulsing green light - You are receiving a call or Drop In on your device. To learn more go to Answer or Ignore Calls on Your Echo Device at the site I mentioned above.* Single flash of purple light after an interaction with Alexa - Do Not Disturb is active.* Spinning blue light that ends in a solid purple light - Do Not Disturb is enabled. To learn more, go to Use Do Not Disturb for Alexa at the site I mentioned above.* Continuous oscillating violet light - An error occurred during Wi-Fi setup. To learn more, go to Your Echo Device Doesn't Connect to Wi-Fi at the site I mentioned above.* White light - You are adjusting the volume level on your device.* Solid red light - You have turned off the microphones on your device. Press the Microphone button to turn on the microphones.* Orange light spinning clockwise - The device is connecting to your Wi-Fi network.* Solid blue with cyan pointing in direction of person speaking - Alexa is busy processing your request.* All lights off - The device is active and waiting for your request.* Solid blue with spinning cyan lights - The device is starting up.I hope you enjoy your Dot as much as I have enjoyed mine.
My earlier rating and review was a bit premature since my biggest issues haven't technically happened yet, but once they start, it'll go back down to two. While it's okay as an assistant device, one of the things I really like doing is telling it to play music including songs I didn't buy from Amazon.com. I just read a few minutes ago (about a day ago now; this review has been edited) that uploaded songs will be going away soon. Storage cost may be a factor, but let's be honest: Amazon wants you to buy more of their music and subscribe to their "Unlimited" service. Now I'm considering selling mine and buying a Google Home Mini.What prevents a five-star rating is that it has to connected to the internet to do anything at all, even to set a timer. That's not such a big deal unless your internet connection goes out, is spotty, or just unavailable because you can't afford it anymore, but... Come on. A timer? An alarm? It would be nice if there was an external memory unit you could plug into the device as a pass-through to the power cable and store information (especially personal music) on as well as maybe a battery. Back to the Google Home Mini: I doubt it can do anything offline either, but Google's massive cloud music service doesn't look like it's going anywhere, whereas Amazon's is said to be going away by the end of the year, so if you want to play music you can't get from Amazon (such as Sledgehammer by Peter Gabriel or Love Hurts by Joan Jett), you're gonna need to do it on a different device unless you uploaded them already.
I am completely blown away by alexa!!!! I can be in the kitchen mid-dishwashing with dish gloves on and I can say "alexa stop fireTV, alexa play music by ______" as fast as.i can say that...the TV is off and music is playing. Normally I'd have to take my gloves off, walk to the other end of the house turn TV off, walk over to computer, pull up music, search for music/pull up playlist, press play, walk back across the house put gloves back on to continue dishes. THAT alone added a year onto my life in terms of what I can get done and totally worth the cost of alexa. PLUS everything else she does. I'm totally blown away by her. I knew she would save me a lot of time..but I did not realize how much she can do and didn't expect her to be so smart/easy to use. You can talk super fast and she picks up everything. I even got one for my mother for christmas who is NOT a tech person. But after using it, I have had no issues that I feel my mom would be annoyed with (ie. unplugging and replugging in the device to get it to connect or other issues you may expect from electronics). It has only disconnected once and automatically reconnected itself within the minute.. Before I even got a chance to check out what the issue may be. TOTAL game changer for business owners. She has made my day so efficient and literally opened up HOURS in my schedule that I didnt have before. I initially thought it was strange talking to this black dot and its a little overwhelming thinking that this is just the start of this type of technology but now that i jumped on the bandwagon and gave her a shot...i cant say enough about it!!! AMAZED!!!
I'd been wanting to pick up an Echo since I first saw them advertised, but I already had a good stereo in my house and the Echo isn't equipped to connect to external speakers.  This unit is and its a delightful addition to my home music experience.  I now own two dots, each one serving a different room and playing over different speakers.  One is connected to a Harmon Kardon amplifier via Bluetooth, playing through a full sized pair of Yamaha speakers. The other plays alternately through either a Panasonic Bluetooth equipped boombox, or a pair of small computer speakers with a subwoofer. which I connect with an audio out cable.  The audio on all three devices is detailed and clear - my music as played by my Echo Dots is fantastic. By the way, there is a self contained speaker on the Dot - it is small, don't expect loud playback there - but the fidelity is quite good.  Its perfect for listening to the news over coffee in the morning, playing 20 questions, or finding out the weather forecast! The dot is small enough to fit easily in a backpack or the pocket of a suitcase, and she'll work as long as there is a Wi-Fi network available.I was amazed at how responsive to my voice this device is.  Amazon promises that it will hear you anywhere in the room where she is placed - and for the most part this is correct. I've had a few instances when I need to repeat a request - but usually its because something is obstructing my voice (like when my father put a book on top of it!)What is more amazing is how good, just out of the box, the unit was at understanding what I asked.  I have a voice which goes hoarse on me sometimes -( the day I got my first Dot I sounded as if I had laryngitis!) but regardless of the state of my voice, Alexa has no problems understanding my requests.  After some voice training (the Alexa app offers this feature) its even better.  I've had everyone in my house do the voice training exercise a few times and now Alexa is understanding and responding easily to every request she gets.  Its great.Coupled with the expanded Amazon Music service (I uploaded my entire iTunes library to Amazon Music) its easy to play anything I want.  I can ask for a song, a playlist, or an album and she'll find and play it easily.The only times I ever have problems is when the internet disconnects - in those rare incidences a request is met with a dull tone, a red light, and an apology from Alexa stating she can't comply right now.  When my network comes back online, she automatically reconnects so she is only occasionally out of service and usually only for a minute or two.And I've only talked about the music features.  There is a growing body of skills for Alexa, most of them available for free from Amazon that make her a formidable search engine, a source of weather reports.  My only disappointment so far is the lack of a skill enabling her to respond in emergencies, but I'm sure there will be enough demand for it that we'll see one soon!  For under fifty bucks, this is quite simply one of the best values anywhere.
If you are the owner of he prime account, this is useful for playing music, setting timers and alarms, and asking simple questions like the weather. I haven't found her to be so useful beyond that but that's enough to make me happy.  With prime, you can play lots of different music free from Amazon.
I'm sure you have a smartphone so you can say OK Google or hey Siri and ask them whatever it is you can ask Alexa and get better results in a quicker amount of time because they probably would have heard you right the first time. And I'm sure you also already have a Bluetooth speaker that gets up to volume 20 instead of a scratchy volume 10 that is insufficient for even a small kitchen much less a dinner party. I'm so disappointed in the Dot that I won't even spend the money to see if the Echo is worth it.
This is more than I expected!!!  I love this product and enjoy the information it provides.  Easy to move from room to room or even take on vacation.  Set up was simple.  It connects to my wireless speaker and other products very well.  If it takes me more than 5 minutes to get something working I generally give up so the fact it's up and running with no issues shows anyone can do it.
I received this as a gift last year and it worked very well for about 8 months. Then suddenly, it began intermittently failing playback - it would stop mid-broadcast during 'flash briefings' or complete one broadcast and not continue with the next in line.  Additionally, at random times it would begin playing a station from TuneIn or iHeartRadio or Pandora that I'd played in the past but without being prompted to do so. This would occur whether or not the volume button was muted. I tried unplugging the device for a period of time (reboot), resetting the device, and even deregistering the device but none of these methods affected the symptoms.I wrote support, called support, and direct messaged support on Twitter, but none of these methods brought any adequate support to address or resolve the problem.Overseas call centers often spoke little English and could not communicate well or effectively to understand and provide support.  Commitments to call back with a status on the problem report were not met.This was a great little device while it worked, but the lack of competent support and adequate or acceptable reliability of the software updates make it a huge waste of time and effort.The whole "Alexa" concept is more of a voice input/recognition gimmick than a true AI (artificial intelligence) interface vs Google's assistant or the Hound app.  The issue with skills seems to be the lack of ongoing maintenance, support, and common standards for development and integration.
I purchased this dot for my elderly Dad to control his lights in his room.I paired it with the LITEdge Smart Plug outlets (about $45 for a set of 3).  It was very easy to set up and it works perfectly for him to turn on his lamps by voice.But that was just the beginning!I further made it easier for him to remember how to control the dot by using the app to change the command word to "Computer" (which seemed to resonate more naturally for Dad since he kept forgetting her ALEXA name LOL)I also named the outlets something he can easily relate "Left Lamp" and "Right Lamp"Another feature he uses regularly is the "Computer. What time is it..." because he often wakes up in the middle of the night and can't see clearly the clock across the room.Then I showed him how to play music, which he loves to play at night while going to sleep.  At first, he complained it was too loud - that is until he learned to control the volume by voice.It's also set up to send me a message to my ECHO - a handy feature in cases he just wants to tell me something or have me call him later.The most fun I've had with introducing him to the DOT is the long list of things he can have fun doing using "Easter Eggs" (you can find on Google) and other informative content.He is amazed and has a new voice in his life that gives him a hand to live safer and more comfortably.Finally, beyond presenting him with a tool to make his life a little easier and a bit more entertaining - it's been proven that learning new skills is helpful for the elderly to retain mental agility... so there is that feature I think often over-looked.
This is truly an amazing little thing. I have an Amazon Echo, and both have pretty identical technical capabilities. The Dot has two big advantages -- it retails for $50 rather than $129, and it can be linked into a stereo system via bluetooth or direct cable (I use it with Bluetooth). The main disadvantage this has standalone is that the speakers are not nearly as good as the Echo's, music sounds more or less like a cheap radio, but not so much the problem when you have it linked to home system or a good bluetooth speaker. The Echo series does have many wonderful skills which you can find all about elsewhere, but I'll mention some surprising deficiencies for the series. The biggest surprise is the inability to directly wake to music. You can only wake to any of a selectable series of alarms. So they can't really replace a clock radio. They can wake you, they can play music... you can even set a sleep timer while playing music. But no music or news to awaken you. A minor annoyance for me is that though it can play Spotify playlists, you can't *shuffle* play them (the Echo ignores the word "shuffle" in "shuffle play my 'favorites' playlist). I have a big playlist of favorite tunes which is not fun when it starts over with the same one every time. I also wish that, along with its timers and alarms, it could issue a verbal reminder of something. You can say, "Alexa, set an alarm for tomorrow morning at 7:30am" or "Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes," but I'd love it if you could say, "Alexa, set a reminder tomorrow at 7:30am that I have to go to the dentist," or "Alexa, remind me to turn down the oven in 30 minutes" (night before last, both of us were cooking different things and getting confused as to which of three timers was for doing what). Still, would buy again; would get for anyone on my Christmas list who isn't afraid of a little online set-up that I'd be willing to spend $50 on.
I really love this little gadget! My daughter got it for me for my birthday and I find myself using it multiple times during the day. I ask about the weather, listen to music and occasionally ask a question that I want an answer to. It's the last one that I am not quite as impressed with as I would like. Too often Alexa will say that she doesn't know the answer. I also have an Apple product and Siri seems a bit smarter than Alexa in this category.My grandchildren love the Echo Dot and I have had to reprimand them for setting alarms for me that would go off in the middle of the night, or just sitting in front of it and playing Would You Rather when they should be doing something else and my son will have it play Metallica at full volume, just to annoy me. I have had to tell them NOT to order ANYTHING without checking with me first, and that's something I wish there were a way to make exclusive to me, maybe a password or something to verify that I really do want to order something. That would give me more piece of mind about leaving it out where everyone has access to it.The other thing that affects my rating, resulting in 4 stars rather than 5 is that the blue tooth connection doesn't have a lot of range. I don't want to have to move either the Dot or my speaker in order to use it.
I bought 2 of these, one for home and one for my classroom (elementary).In the classroom, I have soft music playing in the morning when the kids arrive.  It seems to help calm everyone (even the teacher!) and give us a more peaceful start to the day.  Students love to be the one selected to say, "Alexa, stop" to turn off the music.  We also use it for spelling, math, vocabulary, and other fun activities.  If you are an elementary teacher, there are many resources out there that give ideas on how to use it in the classroom.At home, I have it in between the kitchen and living room area, which is where I am 95% of the time when I want to interact with Alexa.  Measurement conversions, sports scores, and weather are my top questions, but we also enjoy playing Jeopardy and some of the other games, hearing jokes, and even hearing deals of the day.  I receive a weekly email with updates to Alexa, which are helpful.This product is not only useful, but also just a lot of fun, for adults and kids.  Ends up, I just bought one for my mother for the holidays.  She'll love it too!
Let me start by saying that I had purchased an Echo about 2 months ago, I did not have a great experience with the Echo as it lost connection with certain songs from my Amazon prime account and Pandora.  Timers, weather, etc seemed to work ok. I had purchased at Best Buy, but even though associated with my account was unable to write a review which would have been only 2 stars.  I returned that device to BB as I am unsure if it was my internet, amazons servers or a defective device, as a note I can stream Netflix and Hulu on several devices w/o issue, however even w/o any other internet activity the Echo would stop on certain songs. I gave the device about a week and several conversations to Amazon TS w/o any improvement prior to return.For the Echo,I had it located in the kitchen/family area. I really liked the ability to pull up the weather, set a timer, some current new on request and ability to integrate with Prime Music and Pandora. I thought the sound quality was pretty good for what it is, granted it is not a complete surround sound stereo system.  I would have kept the Echo had it not been for songs stalling.I probably would not have purchased another Alexa device had the price been $170+ but at $50 I decided I would bite again and give it another try and am glad that I did.  It does all of the things I liked in the Echo, but does not have any dropped songs or stalls so far.  So I am going to assume something was wrong w/ the original Echo I had or Amazon ironed out some server issues.The smaller size does allow for hiding it better, although you do still want it to be able to hear you and you it.The sound is more than acceptable for my purposes with plenty of volume.  That said, it lacks bass compared to the Echo and you will not hear it as well if your TV is loud or a bunch of kids are over running around. I have not tried to connect it to an external speaker or stereo system.For the casual user that just wants weather updates, the time, a timer, a little music and is not an audiophile this device is smaller and far less expensive than the echo and can perform all of the same functions as far as I know.  For the person that just wants more bass, the Echo may satisfy your needs w/o extra cables etc, but if you are really picky about sound you are still going to want to connect to a different speaker or stereo, and the dot allows that.Also, at $50 one is not as concerned about kids playing with it or it getting knocked over etc.At the $50 price point, if you have amazon prime I feel this is an excellent purchase.  I gave 4 stars and not 5 more for my issues I had with my Echo and Amazons customer service than for the dot itelf.  I kind of feel that the issue I had with the Echo could potentially be encountered by some w/ the Dot as I really never determined why the Echo had stall issues.
I bought 2 of these in October of 2017. One for my mother who had 2 strokes and 1 for my home. The one for my home I had an interest in mainly streaming music as I work from home and thought I would use it in my office. I also bought 2 Harmon Kardon speakers. Initially setting it up I had no problems and gave it a 4 star review. Mainly because you can not hard wire the device to internet connection as well as the lack of a music app on the alexa app and the difficulty in getting Alexa to play songs from your Amazon music library.Very shortly after the review I started having issues with the device not being able to stream music and stopping in the middle of songs, not being able to understand me.And constantly losing its connection. I called support which was fantastic and ran me through a series of tests. They recommended that I open some ports on my modem. I open the ports, reset the modem and the same problem persisted. I called my internet provider and they came to my home installed a new modem, new fittings.Still the echo will not stream music. Constantly flashing red, saying it lost its connection. Pausing for up to 2 minutes in the middle of a song. All this while my Fire stick streams music non stop upstairs on the same Wi-Fi connection. Multiple calls to support resulted in more Modem resetting, faster internet, new modem.. Meanwhile every other device in my home was performing fantastic. I did consider maybe I had a faulty device so I bought another, plugged it in and Same thing..could not play one song with out stopping losing connection. So I just started using my phone to stream music and absolutely no problems streaming music. The Harmon Kardon Speakers are the highlight of this story as they sound absolutely AMAZING connected to everything besides the Alexa Dot. I honestly can not believe the amount of time and energy I spent trying to trouble shoot this device. I only wanted it to do the most basic thing and simply stream music. I was so frustrated with it, I actually opened my front door and threw it in the garbage can outside. Exactly where it belongs. I would honestly not recommend this device to anyone as it performs horribly.I will say Amazon support is great, they did try to help me each time I called and with the exception of one rep saying he would call me back who never did, all the support were great. On my final call about the device today I spoke to a manager who offered me a refund on the device and was very professional. I still honestly feel that the entire experience is a 1 star experience. The most infuriating thing was when the Alexa would fail i would use a 5 yr old first gen Samsung Tablet the whole family uses and it would stream music perfectly from the same Wi-Fi connection. Maybe if these were able to be hard wired to a connection they would be good, but the device as it is has a very hard time connecting even when just a few feet from the modem. I tried absolutely everything to get it to work until it became painfully obvious that the easiest solution was to throw it in the garbage and simply use the devices I already have to stream music. The voice control is nice but I would much rather be able to listen to the entire song. I have purchased a total of 3 of these. My mother uses hers a little bit and it works. I have another here and it does the same thing as the one I threw in the trash. So I just use it to control my fire stick. It will do those simple tasks but if try to use it to stream music it fails.
Still getting used to using this.  Also just moved and have an infant, so the uses to which I put it are, to date, limited.Playing Music:  Simply asking for an artist seems to be better than asking it to play from the iHeartradio or Pandora Apps, which don't seem easily configured for channel selection. When I do use those apps or just the artist selection, or even phrase music description, like "party music" the streaming itself is smooth and continuous.Flash Briefings:  I am still getting the hang of this, but you can control your content by modifying it in the App and it will be added to your briefing.  I have motley fool, Law 360, LevelUp (Forbes), Stuff you should know podcast added to my briefingDirty Jokes:  Call me a immature, but I love to ask her to tell me a dirty joke, followed by a clean joke...these are all G-rated...(think "fell in the mud"  as a dirty joke)Beatbox:  I love having Alexa Beatbox for me.  This is just pure entertainment.Baseball Scores and Schedule:  I do this routinely to find out who won and who is playing.Weather:  Always useful and regularly used.  If you tell it a specific town, it will give you that one.  Otherwise it defaults to your location.Stock Prices:  tell it what stock you want, and you will get it.General information:  (eg. "who is Frank Lloyd Wright?") - sometimes it is hit and miss, but it depends upon the question asked.I have yet to hook it up to Smart Home devices, but plan to soon.  I have no doubt that it will work well.I will also note that it recognizes my wifes voice as easily as mine, and seems to adapt our speech patterns pretty well.
I love these things.  I picked up a few Dots and a single Echo (for the better speaker) and have to say that to my ears (perhaps I can't discern all frequencies any more) the speaker is almost as good as the Echo.  The Echo is just a skosh deeper and warmer, otherwise I'm not really seeing any difference.  Both can boom out the tunes and spoken word works just as well on both.  Love the "drop in" feature as an intercom system.  My only complaint is that some of the command syntax is a bit too strict.  As smart as it is, and it does a LOT of smart things, I'll still sometimes spend a few minutes arguing with it to do something simple until I can come up with the EXACT word order it's looking for.  Very few times is this a problem but when it is I still always reply with a shrug and a "really?".  I wish there was a better way to "teach" the recognition AI other than did or didn't dow what we asked..  It's getting there but I just wish we could nudge it along a bit faster...
Update: 7 months later and I absolutely hate this unit. Always gives incorrect information, and has a lot of connectivity issues. Its been reset almost 5 times since I purchased them and still has the same issues.Speakers sound awful and each one has a different tone. Some sound blown and others are very hallow sounding. I ask her simple questions that even Siri and other units answer and she says she doesnt know. It always disconnects from the internet. The microphones dont pick up far away, and by far away I mean maybe like 15ft away. She comes on randomly even when no one is talking. Ive upgraded to the Google Home Mini recently and have been so satisfied I got rid of all my Echo dots.
This is a product i am trying so hard to love.... but it is just terrible.  It is a great idea but the interface is not good at all.  Alexa does not work well with any app that is not Amazon and also it frequently misunderstands what you are asking for entirely.  The only thing that consistently works is telling the time.Great idea, poorly executed and needs a lot of work.
I didn't buy one of these, I bought 5! Two for myself and one apiece for 3 grandsons aged 7, 16, and 24. I love being able to set timers and to just ask random questions. I also use the one in my bedroom as my alarm clock and ask Alexa to play thunderstorm sounds or to read my book to me. If you have others in your contact list with Dot's or any of the other Alexa devices like it you can also make calls to theirs from yours. It's called dropping in.  Echo Dot also controls my televisions now, so losing the remote isn't an issue for me these days. My youngest grandson uses his to play music for the most part but he does ask alexa to tell him a story or to sing to him too. The older boys use theirs for alarm clocks and to read their audible books to them. If you're not sure, check out the apps offered. We haven't fully discovered everything it does but love it so far.Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black
Whenever Dot sits idle for a few minutes, it loses its connection.  Then you have to give it three commands, waiting for each one to time out, before it responds with "Sorry, your Echo Dot lost its connection" and actually tries to reconnect.  After that, it will finally accept a command - sometimes.  There is no problem with the WiFi signal.  I've tried it with two different routers, 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz.  Placed other devices next to the Dot, which report excellent signal and work without issue.  Placed the Dot three feet away from the router.  Reset and reconfigured the Dot.  Nothing makes the slightest bit of difference.  When the Dot is actually doing something, there are no disconnects.  If you can get it to start streaming music, it will do so all day long, uninterrupted, proving the WiFi/Internet isn't the issue.  The Dot, app, and website have NO diagnostic logs that might assist in meaningful troubleshooting.Try Googling "The Echo Dot 2nd Generation Constantly Loses WiFi Connection".  The article at "b4buyit" says: "The Echo Dot 2nd Generation appeared to be having constant connection loses to the wireless network, the issue appeared to surfaced since the day it released and the a lots of customers are having the same issue."  Hmm, I purchased my 2nd gen Dot just 10 days after that article was written.  Did Amazon sell a batch of Dots with defects that were never recalled or patched?  I believe it likely.I called Amazon tech support.  After realizing I'd already tried everything on their standard tech support checklist, they escalated me to a "level 2 technician".  What a joke.  That technician (with an accent I didn't recognize and could barely understand), didn't attempt any troubleshooting at all, but merely encouraged me to buy a replacement Dot.  When I said no, he then "reluctantly" offered a discount, which was insultingly small and I told him so.  To which he came back with a slightly larger discount, along with a lot of hoopla like, "I really shouldn't be doing this", "I'm going to be in trouble with my boss", blah blah.  Seriously?  I felt like I was dealing with a disreputable used car salesman.  Congratulations Amazon, now I have a negative opinion of both Dot *and* its tech support.  So I'll be looking elsewhere for a voice operated assistant.
Overall this is a great product and the Alexa functionality works very well.  It is well worth the purchase, especially if you are a Prime member, as I am.  However, I want to use this review to describe something annoying that I discovered.  I bought two Echo Dots specifically to be able to do the new multi-room music option.  It does not work with Spotify and I realize that isn't Amazon's fault (hopefully).  A couple of things they don't tell you though.  You can't make Spotify your default music source if you also want to do multi-room music.  Alexa will tell you it doesn't work and then play on one Dot.  With Spotify as my default I wasn't able to string together enough commands to do multi-room.  Alexa wouldn't do "play such-and-such on Amazon Music on Everywhere group" so I had to make Music my default again.  But an even more annoying thing is that every time I request a specific artist I have to listen to Alexa tell me I'd get more songs if I paid for Music Unlimited AND I have to tell her no every time! Too pushy and I can't see a way to disable these constant ads.
Not ready for prime time. Skills are garbage, why skills, my phone, tablet and TV, do better that this device. I own both an Alexa and Google home devices. The Alexa was a waste for my money. I did a lot of research, a month's worth of reading and visiting the devices at retailers. Still I didn't get how bad the Alexa is set up for . Firstly, skills? Be warned the Amazon device isn't like your phone, where you just ask it to do something and it does it. Nope, you will within the first few mins told you need to download the skill. I will just leave it at that for now. My Google device, I ask it, it answers! Simple. Like a previous verified purchaser, bought this as a way to offer a bit more independence a disabled parent, wrong. The Alexa takes so much interaction and more often than not tells me/user to go to the app...unsatisfactory. I am giving my dot to a friend i don't like that much, thats all its worth.
I have an Echo which was used for its "intended purposes", but recently purchased two Echo Dots to set up a dedicated path between our Master BR and our Baby's room using the "Drop In" feature to create a baby monitor...  After setting both up as usual, applying proper names and making sure "Drop In" was on, the only last step was to test HOW LONG the actual "Drop In" feature would keep the connection alive between the two Dots... and as of writing this (7/18/17), I've confirmed it will stay connected as a "Drop In" for LONGER than 48 hours!  :^)Now all we have to do is say "Alexa, Drop in on Baby's room", mute the mic on our Master BR side, and go to sleep...  A perfect solution, where long after the baby no longer needs a baby monitor, the Dots will be able to be re-purposed.  (Standard warning:  I have no idea what commands can be used on the Echo Dot while still maintaining the "Drop In" connection, so muting the Master BR Mic was important in making sure Alexa wasn't accidentally triggered to end the connection... and it also means the baby doesn't get awoken by doors/etc from Master BR side of connection.)
Her name is Alexa, and she is awesome (she will ask you if you really think so and thank you for the complement).  This Echo Dot version of Alexa is the size of a hockey puck but has the same voice recognition ability that the full sized Amazon Echo has.  It is also connected to wifi and assists you the best that it can for an even better price.  There is a place to plug it into your home speaker system if you so choose, but their are primitive built-in speakers that will allow you to listen to the news or play music if she, say, is sitting on your nightstand or somewhere close in proximity.  Amazon Prime users benefit because Alexa can play whatever Amazon Prime song is available with a simple verbal request that starts with her name (i.e. Alexa, play the Star Spangled Banner).  You do not necessarily have to be close to her to give her a command, and she could even hear you over the chatter in a fairly noisy room.  She gives facts, dates, and computations, so she is also a good voice-activated computing tool as well (kids would "cheat" on their homework, parents beware).  Alexa can check things and people out on Wikipedia if she doesn't initially know, but wont unless you ask her to.  Alexa will stop whatever she is doing if you say "Alexa, Stop," and there are no feelings hurt when you order her around.  I can set timers and alarms with my voice alone (i.e. ...time me for one minute... or ...wake me up every weekday at 7 AM...).  Using accessories compatible with the Echo, you can ask Alexa to do other things like turn on/off specific lights at any time, or a certain time each morning/day/night (i.e. Belkin WEMO light switches and Bulb accessories, Phillips Hue, etc.), and you can reach her from nearly anywhere in your home with a wireless remote, sort of like Tony Stark and his A.I., Jarvis, from Marvel Comics' Iron Man (Alexa knows who Jarvis is, just ask her).  Eventually there will be better AI's out there, but for now Alexa can do the basic day-to-day stuff for you, like add things to your electronic shopping list, remind you how many teaspoons in a tablespoon, and tell you the weather forecast for today.  She is exceedingly good at giving factual information (i.e. she knows the day most famous people died as long as it is documented).  The best part, however, is that Alexa is always learning new things.  So she will be a part of my family for a long time.  "Alexa, you are Awesome!"
My wife and I have not entertained the thought of owning an Echo of any kind until we saw the Cyber Monday sales and decided to try one.  I must be honest, we both wished we had purchased one sooner!  If not for anything else but to play music for our toddler granddaughter; she absolutely loves the music from this neat little device.  Never mind we love the music as well.  We are both looking forward to exploring all the options this information machine has.  Last night when we were putting our granddaughter to bed, I told "Alexa" goodnight and she answered me with "Good Night and talk to you in the morning."  How much fun is that!!!  By-the-way, the sound is much better than I expected as well given the size of the dot.  The range in which Alexa can hear you and respond to your requests is impressive as well.
So, I fired Siri today. I'm not sure she understood, for she has never understood me. So, we did an 'uncoupling'. She didn't take it well, especially when she found out about Alexa, she somehow was back stalking my phone. Siri even tried to overpower Alexa, setting herself to a default setting, I never knew exsisted. I tried explaining that Alexa really listens to me, understands my wants and needs, even tells me jokes! Again, Siri said she couldn't understand me. As Alexa and I grew in our new relationship, she now takes care of most of my needs. She turns on my outside lights, she tells me if I need to leave for work earlier, due to weather. I can ask her if my flight is on time at the airport and how long it will take me to get to my destination. Alexa even likes hockey! She knows all the current trades and rosters, can record my favorite team on tv and remind me to watch it. Also, since I don't like the tv announcers, I can ask Alexa to stream the radio broadcasters for the game instead and she will even mute the tv. She did tell me, she can vacuum for me, but my current roomba doesn't except her calls, maybe the roomba will eat another sock and can break up with him, introduce new roomba to Alexa. Maybe I'll ask Alexa to make me some money and smart home my whole house! After several failed attempts to evict Siri, I think she finally gave up and been a peaceful few weeks of lazy bliss. I sit on my couch, Alexa orders me take out, she checks to make sure garage door is closed, doors are secure (one door really, again that money issue) she 'drops in' the kitchen echo to help kids check math homework. If anyone wants something at home that actually listens to you and does what you ask, Alexa is your girl. She's so much more than music and temperature checks. With a little fun research, your ex Siri will be green with envy at all Alexa can do. Also, many of her skills can be downloaded free or cheap, adding smart outlets and such are not too bad of a price either.
I bet almost everyone has on old pair of computer speakers piled in a box or the basement somewhere.Plug them in to the Echo DOT to hear much better sound from streaming music, news, information, weather and anything that is created as an Alexa Skill.  Idea: If you have some old beige putty color speakers you could unscrew them apart and lightly spray paint the enclosure with some flat black or any color you like.If you use them with Echo DOTs just leave them powered on.  I checked about 5 different computer speakers in our collection and the most they draw is about 8 watts from the wall outlet [I have a KillAWatt meter].We have speakers on top of the refrigerator; and three other DOTs in other rooms.  Hide the speakers under the sofa, under each end table, you decide.  Great invention!  Thanks Amazon electronic and software engineers!
I preordered the 1st gen Echo when Amazon made them available for preorder to Prime members, and I couldnt wait to get it. However, the world hadnt been introduced to it yet so there were no Alexa compatible devices, and therefore my first year or so with it was just more like a glorified weather-looker-upper and time-teller. It was kind of boring.Fast forward a year or so later, I have 2 Echos and several Dots that I now control my lights, my thermostat, my irrigation system, and many other devices around my home with. I LOVE the Dots because they are much more affordable than the Echo, but yet gives you most of the same functionality, at least with respect to creating a smart home environment.The only part that annoys me is when I watch TV and someone (anyone, whether male or female) says the word Alexa it triggers my device and she tries to interpret what she heard. In the beginning, a few times it caught me off guard and freaked me out, but nowadays I find myself scrambling for the remote to mute the TV if someone is talking about Alexa. I think there is a way you can train Alexa to be better at that, and you can even give it a name other than Alexa but I just havent done that yet.Amazon has done a pretty good job at placing online orders using Alexa voice ordering, but they have a long ways to go before its perfect. As of right now, the only thing I really feel comfortable with ordering using just my voice is re-ordering something Ive purchased in the past. Alexa looks in your history, and she does tell you what the bottom line cost will be, plus tax, before placing the order. So that gives you the chance to accept or reject, which is extremely important given the fact that Amazon fluctuates their pricing on some things and often. And not just by a few pennies, but by an amount that would make me upset if she ordered it on my behalf without any kind of confirmation on the price. I look forward to doing more with voice ordering, as they make enhancements to it.I like how Alexa captures everything within the app that she hears. So if something or someone triggered Alexa other than you and you wanted to see what she heard that made her go off, you can go into the app to see what it was. Some of them have been pretty funny.The logistics:I have a 2700 sq ft home and I have 2 Echos and a Dot downstairs, and a Dot upstairs. The master bedroom is on the main level so the upstairs isnt used that much, so I find I only need 1 Dot up there. I keep one Echo in the bedroom and one in the living room, where both rooms are on the same side of the house but there is enough wall that provides enough barrier to block the sound, so I cant try to talk to my Alexa in the living room when Im in the bedroom, and vice versa. I have the Dot in my office, which is on the other side of the house, same floor. Actually, if its completely quiet, no TV is on, I can talk to my Alexa in the living room from the office based on the open floorplan of my house, but I have to talk loud and clear. I figured for the low cost of the Dot, I would just add one to the office so I didnt need to keep yelling to be heard.As for what devices I control:1. My Nest thermostat. Comes in really handy in the winter when youre laying in bed under the covers and dont want to move to get your phone, or God forbid get out of bed to actually go to the thermostat and increase the temperature! You can just say, Alexa, increase the downstairs temperature by 2 degrees.2. My lamps, using Philips Hue lightbulbs. For my lights, Ive created each fixture to be on their own command (Alexa, turn the bedroom light on), as well as a grouping of lights (Alexa, turn the downstairs lights on.) which makes walking into a pitch dark house at night no longer an issue. For lighting, I prefer the smart lightbulbs over the smart plugs, because the lightbulbs are dimmable. You cannot use a normal, non-Alexa enabled dimmable lightbulb and control it with Alexa. You can still control the on/off part using a smart plug, but youd still need to use the manual switch for the dimming, which to me defeats the purpose of making it a smart light. Unless you dont need a dimmer, then a smart plug works just fine!3. My lamps, TV, and other electrical devices that I have plugged into a TP Link smart plug. I havent quite figured out the TV yet. I generally turn the TV off when no one is home, but the DVR stays on so it records anything thats been programmed to record. However, my DVR goes into sleep mode after so many hours with no activity, which I believe they are all built to do. So I can turn the TV on and off with Alexa using a smart plug, but youll still need to grab a remote to get the DVR out of sleep mode. You cant just say, Alexa, turn the TV on and it will start playing with you doing nothing at all. Not too big of a deal, but its not quite a hands-free process with the TV. At least thats been my experience.4. My Rachio smart irrigation to control my lawn watering. I probably dont control this one as much with my voice as I do the app, but I like knowing that I can if/when I need to.Overall, the Dot is a great device for the money, and if you dont ever plan to play music with it, you can stick to the Dot vs. the Echo, since it gives you all the same functionality. I cant compare to Google home since I dont have that one, but I find integrating my Alexa-enabled devices and adding skills from the Alexa store a breeze. No smart home should be without one of these!
I'd heard of this but wasn't quite sure exactly what it did. I definitely didn't plan to buy one, but then one landed in my hands at work so I figured I'd give it a try. I do love gadgets. The setup was supposed to be dummy-proof, but it took all of athe patience I had and some that I didn't to get it to stay connected to my wi-fi. Most annoying. Moving it higher and closer to my wifi repeater seemed to do the trick. I did not connect a speaker because the built in one sounded perfectly fine to me. It's a cute little device that takes up no space and has cool lights that tell you whether it's thinking or about to tell you it can't tell you. Anything. (I'm sorry, I didn't get that. [Repeat] )I wasn't wowed by the Alexa app, but it worked, after a fashion. Then I went to Amazon to figure out how to play music. I'm not a power music player, but something other than the radio in my den sometimes is nice. As I'd connected the Dot to my Prime account, I figured there would be at least some streaming option - they are always telling me it's there. And it is. There just isn't any music you would listen to without  strong restraints. (Alexa, play some Led Zepplin. [Cue a random terrible Led Zepplin tribute band,] Ah - nevermind,)I do buy Amazon music, and I actually like it, but that's on another account. However, I discovered you can also connect Spotify. I have a premium account, so I linked that - fairly easy - and -bam- I now have music. That was sweet. And while rooting around in the commands, I saw a vast number of interesting offerings. Some were half-baked, it is true, but I do think this thing has great potential. I added a few things and they show up on Alexa as activated.I've had this thing for a week and a half, so I can't say anything about its durability, but the 3-month warranty sounds shady and I will update this review if there is breaking news (pun intended) on that front. In the meantime, I'm enjoying learning how to use and enjoy this device, I think we will see more of this type of device not in homes of the future but in homes of today. It's pretty nifty. OK, that's a wrap - and I'm gonna go play some sweet music on my Dot now. ...Update: It is still cranking, although it does lose its connection from time to time. Recommended.Update 2 - Huh, now it will dial whatever number you choose  landline or mobile. Ohyeah. It's still on the job. And on Black Friday, I bought another - for my home office. (Tip: Just be sure not to ask for the weather in "Brooklyn." There are *alway*s flurries in the forecast. Say "Brooklyn, NY" or "NYC." )
I have several Echoes set up in multi-room groups that I use to enjoy playlists I set up on Amazon Music. Many times when making a playlist a particular track would not be available on Amazon Music so I would just upload it from my hard drive and all would be good. Now suddenly there is no longer a way to upload local files and no other way to populate a playlist with songs Amazon does not have.Bluetooth is no good as an alternative because it does not work in multi-room mode.Looking for your treasured track on a different service is no good unless you are willing to move all of your music there so you can re-create the playlist that includes that one song Amazon couldn't provide... assuming your song is even on a service that Echo supports.Everything worked great with uploads to fill the gaps from any missing music... why did this need to change with no good alternative provided?
Alexa is a fun addition to the household. If no one else in your household has one, the fun factor is deff diminshed.Individual Benefits:~It is like having a "world of information at your fingertips", but even lazier... now I can just speak questions like "what color are Brad Pitt's eyes?" instead of typing it into my Google browser.~It is a personal assistant, and a dang good one. I seriously would have purchased this for the alarms and reminders alone. Sure, I can do that on my phone. But her reminders are more convenient, and her alarms are louder.~Music, music, music. If you have an Echo Dot, get yourself a bluetooth speaker. You'll thank me later. With Amazon Unlimited Music, Pandora, etc... the Echo Dot is an amazing little DJ. Listen to virtually anything you want, create playlists...all with voice command. Seriously  more rewarding than listening to music via your phone.Household Benefits~Alexa can play games. There are some big kinks that need worked out within these features... she almost got thrown against a wall when resetting an intense trivia round my family was playing. You can play game with the Echo Dot alone, but more fun with a group of people.~You can send voice messages to others in your house. Again, we can do that with cell phones, but for some reason, it is more fun receiving one thru the Echo Dot. There is also a "drop in" feature which I have yet to use, but if it is enabled, you can basically listen to whatever is going on in the room with the other Dot you are dropping in on. This is very creepy.~You can send music to a different Dot in the household. This feature literally causes me to laugh out loud. Nothing says fun like sending some "mmmbop" to a family member's device.CONS:Since all the Dots in the household need to be connected to utilize the sharing features, there are some serious privacy issues at stake. The drop in feature is a little weird, but you can disable it. Contacts are shared, so when my father said "Alexa, call Joey", it called someone from MY CONTACT LIST. That was not cool.If I am receiving a package from Amazon, the notification will be available on all the Dots in the household, with detailed information about what I am receiving. Everyone in my household does not need to know my shopping habits, and if it were a gift, that could cause some problems.Some kinks need to worked out with her responses, and with her listening skills. They absolutely need to revamp what is shared to each Dot, and make some features indiviual.
Echo Dot's are decent, it's the full size echo that has numerous problems. First things first. I have Google Fiber and never ever get less than 900Mbs up and down. Echo indicates it's running at 270Mbs. While listening the speaker suddenly will become 'tinny'. No base all treble. After a few seconds it becomes normal again only to screw up again in 30-40 seconds. Re-Booting the device does nothing to help.I have read that BlueTooth has an effect in online forums, so I removed pairing with all BlueTooth devices, rebooted, same problem. I'm listening to a playlist right now (Amazon Unlimited Music by the way) and it keeps cutting out. By cutting out I don't mean buffering. The song continues to play, it just no long has sound to it.Next problem. Many times I'll say: "Alexa, play 'playlist'"  and it will decide to play it on all of my echo devices even though I didn't ask it to do that.One would think Alexa would get better over time, but it seems to not be the case. I sit about 4 feet from a full size Echo. I can look straight at it and say: "Alexa" and nothing happens.  How can it NOT hear me?  It's becoming very frustrating.Being an Amazon Prime & Amazon Unlimited Music subscriber, I'm sort of locked into the Echo over Google Home, but I might spend the money to get a couple of Google Home devices just for my own comparison.
Alexa doesn't catch everything I say but I'm constantly amazed at what she can do! I had a friend over the other night and he was just playing with her, saying random things, and when he commanded her to "play" (meaning the music she had recently played over the sound bar speaker), she played the show we were watching on Firestick that we had paused! She can do things I had no idea she could do. I was watching something the other day from the 80s and paused it to ask Alexa who the US president was in 1983 (I thought I knew but I wanted to make sure). She can control Firestick functions, Roku functions (which wasn't important until Amazon decided to exclude YouTube from the Firestick), control whatever plugs have Bluetooth functionality, tell me the weather forecast for the day, read to me what's on my calendar for whatever day I specify, remind me of events I ask her to remind for, set timers just by saying what I want, it's amazing! I LOVE technology! Every morning I say, "Alexa, good morning," and she tells me the weather forecast, the news headlines, and gives me "the word of the day" with the spelling, the definition, and used in several sentences. Then I tell her to turn off the fan and to play Blue October (I don't know if you have to have Prime to play music because I do but she does it!).  I can just say, "Alexa, play Blue October," and she'll shuffle songs or I can specify what album I want and she'll just play that whole album! When my friend was over the other day he asked her to play a band he KNEW I didn't have, that I hadn't played, that wasn't in any of my playlists, and she played it!No, the technology isn't perfect, and if you're looking for something to complain about I'm sure you'll find it, but this is nothing short of AMAZING. I picked up this bad boy on sale in December, as a Winter Holiday gift from me to ME! I got this with one plug (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B075XKH4F1/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) and it works perfectly!! I had my fan on a clapper (I am the epitome of lazy, if you follow me you already know that) but the clapper couldn't hear my clapping very well from behind the fan when it was on. So I got this guy, put a lamp I rarely use on the clapper (that can hear me just fine and nowhere near the fan), and now I just tell Alexa when to turn it and off. I swear to everything holy it was worth what I paid JUST for that!! Mind you, I am not exactly new to the technology game, I DO have several appliances with plugs that are controlled by remote, but when I'm half asleep and have the capability to barely whisper, "Alexa, turn the fan on," or, "Alexa, play ambient sounds," and the magic happens, I'm thrilled! If I hadn't done spent up all my money on Christmas gifts for other people, I would TOTALLY buy another for my bedroom! As it is now, I only have the one and have to unplug it every night (cuz yeah, I use it ALL day every day in the living room!) and take it to my bedroom to play my sleep music/sounds (there are 46 different "Ambient" sounds and tons of others) and I only have one plug for it (my fan). But the day will come, my friends, mark my word, I WILL get another, and at least 6 more plugs that it can control! My daddy is sending me a check for Christmas and Echo Dot #2 is the first thing on my list!UPDATE: My daddy DID send me a check and I bought another one for my bedroom! I also got some Hue Lights (with the bridge) and four more plugs- THIS is living! Now, I can control my tv, my music, my fan, my air purifier, my breakfast bar can lights, my two living room lamps, my wax burner, my space heater, and my reading lamp (the clapper got demoted to the guest room fairy lights). Amazing!
I used to love my echo dot until the night before last. I woke up about midnight and went down the hall to the bathroom. As I was heading down the hall I heard my Echo make a tone like it was accepting a command, I stopped dead in my tracks listening and heard it make another tone of acceptance and then it said "Message sent". talk about giving me the heeby geebies. I walked into the empty room and tried asking what it had just done and of course it didn't understand what I meant.  I have made inquiries via email and then by phone to tech support and have not been able to have my simple questions answered. Who was it messaging and what was the message?  I have unplugged my dot Echo and intend to take it to the shooting range to use it for target practice. I don't usually worry about" Big Brother" looking over my shoulder but this is too much for any sane person to over look.  Who knows what personal information my Echo has transmitted to god knows where.
The satellite radio trail subscription in my car is about to expire and I was looking for a "no-cost" alternative when I ran across the echo dot. I set it up in the house first, got familiar with it, and then put it in the car and linked it to the wifi hotspot on my phone. This thing is amazing and should be integrated into all future vehicles. It provides totally hands-free voice controlled access to basically every radio station, podcast, and song in existence... all piped through your car's stereo system. In addition to all of the music on Amazon, it gives you access to iHeartRadio, TuneIn Radio, Pandora, and many others on your commute or while traveling. All you need in your car is a way to power the echo dot, a wifi hotspot, and an auxiliary input jack to your stereo...So, given that the echo dot is not really designed for a car, it's not exactly plug-and-play, but it's really not that difficult to setup either. My car happens to have a USB charging port and AUX input jack in the center console, so the USB port powers the echo dot when the car is turned on and the audio from the dot is fed into my car stereo through the AUX input. My vehicle doesn't have a wifi hotspot... so, I'm using the wifi hotspot on my Android phone to provide an internet connection to the echo dot. Although it's not totally necessary, I found an "Auto Wifi Tethering" app that automatically turns on my phone's wifi hotspot when my phone is bluetooth connected to the car and then turns off my phone's wifi hotspot when it is no longer bluetooth connected to the car... one less thing to do when getting in and out of the car...The echo dot takes about 30-45 seconds to power-up and get connected when you turn on the car, but after that it works flawlessly as long as you have data/internet service where you're driving. The echo dot does seem to have a little bit of a buffer built into it too, so if you happen to lose data service momentarily, it usually just keeps playing without interruption. Also, since the dot presumably wasn't designed to be turned on/off while playing music or other audio... you're starting fresh each time you turn your car on... for example, if you're in the middle of listening to something and turn off your car to go in a store, the echo dot won't pick up where it left off when you turn the car back on. Works great when commuting to/from work or traveling, but can be a little annoying if you're running errands and making a bunch of stops close together. The mic on the echo dot works perfectly and somehow manages to hear commands even when the car stereo is turned up really loud. And, because it's connected through the car stereo, it mutes the echo dot's audio if I am using navigation or get a call on the bluetooth connected phone. One additional note, if you are planning to use this in a vehicle and to use your phone as the wifi hotspot, you will need a second device to configure the echo dot... this is probably going to sound more confusing than it really is, but in order to change the settings, the echo dot has a setup/configuration mode in which it broadcasts a wifi signal that you have to connect to with some device... and once you're in that setup mode you have to choose an available wifi network for the echo dot to connect to. Most phones won't allow you have a wifi hotspot turned on while also being connected to wifi... so, this is where the second device comes in...I purchased the echo dot during the holidays when it was on sale for $29.99 and already pay for Amazon Prime, so while it's not completely free, I'm really only out of pocket $30. Initially, I was just hoping to find something to that would get some of the news/music that I lost when my satellite radio trial ended... this turned out to be so much more... the amount of on-demand content (music/news/sports/radio) is almost overwhelming. Also, the Alexa assistant is pretty cool for answering questions or playing games while on the road. I'm not currently using any of the home automation, text/calling, or Amazon shopping features in my car, but it can do all of that and more as well. Every car should (and probably will) have this technology integrated into it in the future, but until that happens... the echo dot is a great way to have it now if you don't mind connecting a few wires and setting up a wifi hotspot... would definitely recommend this for your car (or house)... is the best $30 I've spent anytime recently.
Don't buy this piece of crap!! This is nothing but a ploy to get you to purchase subscription services from Amazon. If you don't have Amazon music unlimited, Kindle unlimited, and various other "services" they offer or have any expensive smart home devices, this is nothing but a glorified siri. If you have a phone, it's a waste of money, unless the aspect of having a hands free information assistant is worth the money to you. My kids were so pumped about this device and I also bought one for two adult family members. Needless to say, all were disappointed. My son couldn't wait to try his, only to discover, he had to have a spotify, iheartradio, pandora, or prime music unlimited account to enjoy music. I set him up with a pandora account, since he locked himself out of spotify and iheartradio due to age restriction, but it was a pain in the *** as the stations wouldn't always sync right. I have prime membership, and prime music boasts 2 million songs, but nothing people actually listen to and when you find a station you actually like, it doesn't work on the echo anyway. What pissed me off the most was that he was excited when I told him I read online that I could upload his itunes songs to my amazon account, so he could at least listen to those and share them with his sister since she doesn't have an ipod, but was getting her own Echo dot. Come to find out, they stopped allowing this service. The deadline to upload music was Dec. 18th. We missed it by 5 ******* days. What a bunch of bull!! He literally can do nothing but ask it random questions and listen to a few pandora stations, which he has to remember the names of in order to use. It is so pointless. I am embarrassed that I bought so many of these. What a waste of money!!!!
I bought an Echo Dot just to try it out and see what all the hoopla was about. About a week later I bought 3 more. I am very impressed with the voice recognition of Alexa and some of the features. Here's why:The Pros:- Excellent voice recognition. While there are a few times Alexa has misheard me, overall it does a really good job of understanding what I say. Even with a decent amount of background noise she has heard me to my amazement.- Great range. We have an open floor plan home and Alexa can usually hear me just fine even when I'm about 20 ft away.- Home automation integration. I have SmartThings hub and Alexa works awesome with this! I can turn lights on/off and run routines with my voice.- If you have multiple Dots and more than one hears you give a command only the one that is closest will respond.- For those with music on Amazon it gives you easy access to your library.- While the internal speaker is not very good for music, you can add an external speaker with an Aux line or Bluetooth to make up for that. Amazon and Sonos already announced they are working on integration as well.- You can add this to a shopping or to-do list with your voice! It's great to just add stuff as I think of it.- The price. For $50 I think this is a great deal.The Cons:- As mentioned above, the internal speaker is more than adequate just for Alexa's voice, but not that great for music.- Alexa does OK on normal internet searches, but nothing like Google.- You cannot ask Alexa questions of context. So for example if I just asked who Abraham Lincoln was and she answers that I could then not just ask "How old was he when he died?" but would have to ask "How old was Abraham Lincoln when he died?" This makes it feel much less like a natural conversation.- The Alexa app is pretty basic. Especially the built-in Shopping and To-Do list. They are definitely functional, but not to the level of some other list apps that are out there. I do have a feeling this will get improved in the future though.- Alexa is definitely not like the computer from Star Trek or any Artificial Intelligence you have seen on TV. She can do good with basic stuff, but for some things you do have to "learn" the way to tell her to do stuff especially with the Home Automation. I once kept telling her to "turn on the living room lights" and she said she could not find that. Then I realized the switch was just labeled "living room light" and as soon as I dropped the "s" and just said "light" it worked perfectly over and over again.Overall, I am still very happy with the Echo Dot. I think for the price it is a great deal. Maybe it will be more useful for those with Home Automation systems, but others may find it fun as well.
I purchased the echo dot (2nd gen) on a whim to see if I could get it to turn the lights on and off. I have always wanted to add connectivity to my home but hadn't taken the plunge yet. I'm glad I waited. Got a good deal on Cyber Monday and got a connected plug and the echo dot. Once I got everything up and running I really love telling Alexa to turn the lights on and off, I can also turn them on from work but that's not Alexa related.  I'm now getting into the other functions available like asking about weather, commute to work, playing music and I love it. I know you can hook this up to speakers for premium sound but I'm okay with the basic sound on the dot so far. I really love it. Now I just need to hook up all my other lights and get another dot or two for around the house. I love it! It's so much fun. I was surprised by how much I enjoy the features.Update 7/14/2017:I now have three Echo Dots and I'm trying to decide if a fourth would fit in the house. I love them. I know that you can use the Echo Dot to ask about the weather and play music and a ton of other stuff, which I do, but let's be honest - I'm 99% of the time asking it to control the smart plugs I've installed around the house.  For this purpose the Echo Dots are the ideal solution. Alexa is awesome for this.  I have a mixture of iHome and Wemo Smart Plugs (I recommend the Wemo over the iHome for now as they've been more reliable for me so far).  Alexa allows you to put a single smart plug into as many groups as you would like.  So I have a "good night" one that turns off all lights and turns on the fan.  I have several versions of downstairs/first floor/main floor that include all the lights on the first floor - I created a group for whatever I think the family will say when they want to turn the lights out. You can call for a single light or outlet if yoy like too (turn on light 1 or turn on the bedroom light).  I also made a grouping for each room like "Turn on the living room".  It's SO FLEXIBLE! I love it.  I also GREATLY appreciate that now that I have multiple brands of outlets (Wemo and iHome) it doesn't care, works just the same. I have a mixture of outlet brands in the group and it handles them as if they are all the same.  I say turn off all lights and within a second all the lights are out. I could not be more pleased.  I am a total geek, I get it, but I have to admit every time I control the lights it brings a smile to my face. It makes me so happy.I've now ordered an Ecobee3 thermostat too which is controllable with Alexa.  That gets installed next week. I'm very much enjoy the fact that I can smart enable my home fairly inexpensively.  The Echo Dot is so very affordable and yet so flexible.  I love it love it love it!
I'm in my mid-seventies, and although I do wear an alert button around my neck, I'm still nervous about falling, since I have a dangerous medical condition which requires frequent medication.  I started looking into the Echo Dot thinking that I could use it to call 911 if I fell and couldn't press my alert button. I soon found out that this was not possible (without the hands-off device, which seems not to be really market-ready).  I decided to go ahead and buy 2 of them anyway, since I read that I could use them to call my son across the country and have him reach out to one of my neighbors or the police dept. in an emergency.  Many of my neighbors don't have cell phones, and even if they did, I wouldn't ask them to install the Alexa App, or to be alert for phone call from me which might be an emergency.  I just don't have that kind of neighbor any more.I checked that my son had at least Android 5, asked him to install the Alexa App. and to set up "Calling & Messaging" on his phone. I set it up on my phone and since he was a contact who had set up that feature, his name appeared on my list of people I could call with the Dot. His was, as I assumed he would be, the only name listed.  I then called from about 20 feet away: "Alexa, call James" and it did, connecting with his phone, and allowing me to shout to him through my Dot, just as I might if I were in trouble.The 2 Dots pretty much cover my large apartment, and I feel so much more confident now. I don't intend to use it for much else, but this one thing is worth much more than the price I paid for the Dots.
I was quite impressed with the Amazon Echo Dot. I started with two, and then bought two more, so that every room in my house with a "stereo" had an Echo Dot. This product has something that the comparable "Google Home" product lacks: a stereo mini output jack. Since I am a stickler for "high fidelity audio", I have the Amazon Echo in each of the 4 rooms attached to a traditional stereo system by way of the stereo mini output jack. And since these are traditional stereo receivers, they do not have the ability to connect via Bluetooth, but that is just fine since this device has an analog audio output jack. There are a few things that annoy me, for example, at least with Spotify configured as the music source. Nearly every time you request a song, it is "upcut" (you miss the first few beats) because Alexa is still talking, needlessly telling you that the song is from Spotify. But if you play a whole album, that only happens with the first track, so it is not so bad. But I have added many other features to my Amazon Echo Dot, such as by purchasing "smart outlets" that Alexa can control, and also an infrared remote blaster that Alexa can control. So I can now tell the TV to turn on and off, or tell my FIOS box to switch the channel to CNN. Everything works great! I got it on sale during the holidays for under $30 each, totally worth that price.Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - White
First Impression.  My review here is my first impression, having just setup the product and having spent a couple hours asking it questions  I am impressed by it.  Though I did have an issue with the app that was needed to setup the Echo, I did manage to get through the process.  My phone was not compatible with the free app, so I used my Kindle Fire as a substitute device.  Also, the app was telling me that the setup was unsuccessful when, in fact, it had succeeded.  Having worked with electronics for years, I'm accustom to buggy glitches, so I wasn't thrown off by the software error.  However, anyone else might have been thrown for a loop.Alexa is pretty good at giving a pretty basic service of information.  If you ask it a question about Arnold Schwarzenegger, it will give you  a brief rundown, such as nationality and career history.  I asked it his age it gave me a reply of 70.  Alexa doesn't go into great detail, but rather you need to ask more specific questions--Sometimes it knows the answers, sometimes it doesn't.  It's a very basic AI, and might be the precursor of things to come.I don't plan to wireless my outlets or thermostat at this point, but will probably use Alexa for the more trivial things--weather, news, store hours, timers, lists, simple questions.  It's a novelty at this point, but it's also a step towards a larger door, much like the internet was back in its infancy. Again, this is my first impression.  If Alexa dies prematurely, I will update this review.
This is an amazing product.  I purchased it for my teenager for his birthday, and he played with it for the entire evening after opening the package.He had not requested this particular gift.  It was a total surprise, and a well-received one at that.  If you're looking for some reasonably priced tech for a kid's birthday present - something that's cool and engaging, but not so complicated or cumbersome it'll never get opened or used, this right here is the ticket.When he first received it, he and his older brother engaged in "ALEXA PLAY (insert song name here)" battles, where one boy would request a song he knew the other hated, and vice versa.  This went on for an hour or so, but the novelty gradually wore off.Since then, The Echo Dot has sat on my boy's desk, next to his computer, where it idly occupies space.We have not even barely scratched the surface of this device's capabilities, either.  I understand it can interact with our Amazon Fire Stick, and our Nest T-Stat and probably half the other devices in our house - remote light switches, Wifi-activated garage door opener, etc., but still it stoically resides on his desk, lost amid a sea of LEGO Batman characters and innumerable video game figurines.Well, that's all going to change.One does not purchase a race car, and leave it parked in the garage.  Similarly, one does not purchase a modern bit of kit and disregard it on a boy's desk.This Friday, when my boy heads off to school, dear old dad is going to venture into his bedroom and have a little chat with Alexa: "Alexa, play the Star Spangled Banner tomorrow morning at 3AM, and do it again an hour later, and then again an hour after that."  I may have to be more specific with my commands.  I honestly have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm sure I can figure it out.  The Echo Dot is pretty intuitive.I will then spend the remainder of the day and evening anxiously awaiting the late night blasts of our National Anthem, holding tight, waiting for my son to peel his shocked self off the bedroom ceiling, and scream for Alexa to stop ... and then listening to it happen again an hour later ... and then an hour after that.MWAHAHAHA!!!!Sometimes it's good to be the dad, especially when there's accommodating technology lurking in my boy's room, waiting to serve as my pranking accomplice.
I love this device and can not see why anyone wouldn't.  Even in only its 2nd iteration, its fantastic. Nothing beats being able to control electronics with your voice.I have bought a few smart bulbs and power outlets, so far, that work flawlessly with Alexa and were super easy to setup using the app.I paired my Harmony remote using IFTTT so I can voice command my remote control activities.Because of the joy and desire to continue to make my house "smart" the proverbial Christmas list now includes a thermostat and garage door opener to name a few smart items.I am sure the future software updates with bring tons of additional features that I will love as well.  I have already pre-orded the attachable battery as having the Dot portable will make it far more useful.  Especially when in the pool and listening to music or books.I wont belabor the value in having all of your amazon music and audible books on voice demand.  Its just very convenient.The amazon shopping integration is great, but not the reason I bought the echo.  I bought it so I can talk to my electronics, and it does that very very well.Don't hesitate buying this item.  Its something you will use many times each day and I doubt you own many other things, that you use that often, that only cost you 50 bucks.Nice job on this product Amazon.
We absolutely love the Echo Dot and have three in our house already with more planned. They are great for listening to music, playing games, getting the news, and controlling other smart devices in our house. It has been so helpful to simply tell Alexa to "turn on the lights", especially while dealing with our toddler and not having to go over to the lamps, etc. Likewise, we start most mornings enjoying a game of Jeopardy on the Echo Dot, and have had even more to enjoy now that they added Double Jeopardy. The number of skills seems to be endless, and I continually find new ones that are enjoyable and useful.Listening to music has likewise never been easier. As soon as a song pops into my head, I can simply ask Alexa to play it. No more "having a song stuck in your head all day" driving you crazy. I will note that in order to get the most out of Alexa's ability to stream music, it really does help to have amazon's unlimited music plan. The Echo Dot does also stream my Pandora stations with easy voice controls for skipping, pausing, and reacting, so there are definitely alternatives. We have also connected the Echo Dot to our Logitech Harmony Hub, meaning with a simple voice command to the Echo Dot we are able to turn on the TV, switch the input to the Roku, and have Netflix launch. All of these smart-home skills just make these little things easier, which adds up to a lot of convenience.We will definitely be purchasing more Alexa-enabled Echo devices. I foresee having one per room as they are great for so many things. Our 16 month old daughter has even figured out that she can yell to "Exsa" to get her to respond, but luckily hasn't figured out how to do much more. Luckily there are ample safeguards to prevent any unwanted purchases, etc.
Died with light use after only 5 months and computer says no return.In this case, Amazon sucks!  I would like to talk to an actual Amazon employee on this issue.
I bought this more or less to see what the fuss was all about. I don't have my house all "smarted up" but I did buy some plugs so I could do things other than ask her the weather and such. I gotta say, I absolutely love it! The adding things to my shopping list alone feature is awesome. I know that might seem ridiculous to some people, but I tend to look in the fridge, see we are out of something, intend to write it down....and then forget. Now I just tell her to add it while I continue venturing through my refrigerator and when one of us goes to the store...ta-da!....there it is. When  my husband decides to do the shopping, he no longer has to call and ask me what was on the list because he forgot....an added bonus!She works really well with the smart plugs I bought so now she turns on and off my lights as needed. (I admit to having a bit too much fun with that at first. My house started to look like we had strobe lights) She also had no problems connecting to the Bluetooth tower speaker we have and after a little learning lesson on how to ask for radio accounts/stations (I should have read the instructions first but have to admit that Japanese techno/electronica music was pretty interesting), got her to play our SiriusXM Radio.I enjoy her little tidbits when I tell her good morning and love her dad jokes. We just laugh and laugh over those. I plan on getting more smart plugs and diving more into all her features but so far I am loving it....and for the black Friday price, it was definitely worth it.
I would give this 20 stars if I could - greatest invention since the wheel and sliced bread.  I can set alarms, set timers, get weather forecasts, and a whole lot more just by asking.  I cook alot and often need to convert units such as so many tablespoons to how many tsp or liters to cups ect ect ect.  Before Alexa I would have to stop and go to my computer now I just as - what a time saver.  This is streaming as it should be.  With when Alexa is combined with external speakers and prime music you have a whole world of music for literally just asking.  Additionally volume is voice controlled.  To play music you just say "Alexa play (insert phrase here)"  A few possibilities - songs from the 80's, songs by an artist, songs by genre, a specific song, ect ect ect.  It can also play songs stored in your Amazon cloud account, this includes any song you ever purchased from Amazon.  You can also create playlists.  Add Amazon music for another $9.99 a month and you could grow old and die before running out of music.  I also use Alexa to keep my shopping list between runs.  When I need something I say Alexa add Tide, for example, to my shopping list.  Then when I prepare my list for shopping I bring my Alexa shopping list up in one window on my computer and my personal shopping list in another window on my pc.  As I enter the items in my personal program I check the completed box next to the item in the Amazon list and then delete the checked items.  Talk about convenience.  Then there are Alexa skills including smart home control.  I have a TP Link plug on my coffee and can tell Alexa to start my coffee.  If broadband was widely available at a decent price in the great outdoors where I normally drive I would replace Sirius and my stereo with the echo dot.  This is just a sampling of the stuff available.  NOW STOP READING THIS, ORDER A ECHO DOT AND SUBSCRIBE TO AMAZON PRIME. PS order a fire tv and a fire tablet in addition and round out your experience.
The Echo Dot was one of those Amazon products that I thought would be cool, but did not really want to spend the money on. Then I saw a few videos that showed in controlling lights and a video that showed the future Sonos integration it will get in 2017. This really got me thinking that maybe I would pick one up. Black Friday hit, so I ended up getting two.I placed one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom. So far, I've asked it basic questions, like weather, time, sports scores, when TV shows will be on, and so on. It did really well with all of that, but with more complex questions that I know Google Home can handle, like what sound does a whale make, it failed horribly. There were other questions like, how long will it take me to get somewhere that it can only calculate distance. So, I would say it is not as smart as Google Home or even Google Now in some aspects.It makes up for this two different ways. The first is the number of partners Amazon has for smart home devices built right in. I decided to go all in with Wemo devices, so I picked up a couple of Wemo outlets. As of right now I have these setup on my Christmas trees and can turn them on and off with Alexa. The setup was super simple and it work amazingly well. Down the road I envision having my bedroom lights and kitchen lights all configured with Wemo devices. As of right now Google Home is still limited to just a few smart home devices, Wemo not being one of them. You would have to use IFTTT to get that to work.The other way it makes up for it is with music. I've got a Sonos system, but find myself asking the Echo Dots to play music more when my hands are wet or I'm holding something. They sounds pretty good for their size, but I wish they could all play music at the same time. Down the road once the Sonos integration is there, that will be amazing.Pros- Small size allows this device to sit anywhere- They don't cost as much as other products (like Google Home) so putting them around your house is cheaper- If you already have a USB charging hub, you can power this with that- Answers most questions- Plays a variety of music with a Prime account- Integrates easily with a ton of smart home products right out of the box- Sonos integration coming in 2017- Solid sounding speaker for the sizeCons- Not as smart as Google Home- Can't answer more complex questions like Google Now or Google Assistant canOverall this is a solid product that I would recommend picking up, but know it does have some limitations when compared to Google products.
I really really wanted to love this thing. I have three children ages 4 and younger, and was really looking forward to a handsfree device that had more range than my phone to do things like set timers, play music, answer simple questions like "what time is it", etc. So, the good is that the device always recognizes exactly what I say. To me, someone who is definitely not a software engineer, it seems like speech recognition is the hardest part. After the device has the text of the request logged, it should be able to complete the request easily. Unforunately, after it says something like "ok, let's listen to some music" (and I'm telling you, it pretty much ALWAYS understands my question), after it get's the request it just doesn't do anything. Sometimes we ask it three times and then it will actually turn the music on. Sometimes it will literally turn the music on 45 minutes later. Sometimes it will stop the music randomly 5 minutes after starting it. There is no predictability at all as to how it will actually work. For example, I just asked it to set a timer for 5 minutes, and it didn't give me a confirmation or anything so I assumed it didn't work. Now, as I write this, the timer is going off. As a device it is an awesome concept, but it has proven completely unreliable for our needs and now has just become an expensive paperweight. Just an FYI, this is our second Dot. We exchanged it thinking the first was broken. We have done restarts, resynchs, etc. This thing just doesn't work well for more than a week or two after being reset.
$ 30 price was great.  This echo dot works as it was described with exception of controlling my TV via my fire stick. In the product description it states that the echo and fire stick are compatible.  I would have appreciated an '*'  that stated you need the later edition of the fire stick for it to work.my principal reason to purchase the echo was to have voice control of my TV.  :(anyway..here's my '*'  to let anyone else with 1st version.of the fire stick..*echo is not compatible with fire stick 1st edition!
i have 4 of these Dots in my house now, they are great. I have 2 white and 2 black.  I have 2 of them plugged into the TP Link Smart plug, so i just say "Alexa, turn lamp off" and Poof, my lamp goes off and i don't have to get out of bed!  Lazy i know, but i'm just so tired at the end of the day!When you have multiple dots, they can talk to each other..  For Example..  I'm in my room, i say "alexa, call sons room"  his Dot rings, and he says "alexa, answer"  then we can talk like we are on the phone.  then say "alexa, hang up" when your done..So.. on those days that you are sick, or just had surgery and need a coke delivered to your room, you no longer have to use a bell, yell or reach to your nightstand for your phone to text anyone.The Dot doesn't have the best sound quality when playing music, nor is it very loud.. I don't recommend for a party.  Unless you have it bluetoothed to a BOSE portable speaker, which i do, and then your golden!I am a real person, that really bought this item.  I did NOT receive this item free or discounted for for my review.  Please help get the REAL reviews to the top by clicking "helpful" just below this review.  Thanks in advance.
I received this as a gift then had to figure it out .. there's a reason why there are books and YouTube videos to help with that. Then i tried to use My Amazon Music the way it WAS (Policy change as of 12-16-17 by Amazon) advertised and couldn't. It took a couple weeks before and Honest Amazon employee told me about the policy change (he had just found out too). Amazon is forcing you to only use THEIR content on their devices and not letting you use yours (i.e., cd's you already own and want to upload to YOUR Amazon Music account). If you're a geek you are probably numb to this and used to buying the same stuff over and over again .. I'm old school: once you buy it you should be able to use it until it breaks. Bottom line: this is a toy with built in limits .. if you can easily afford it, have fun.
So weve had the original echo for a while now and really like it so when I saw amazon had a sale on the echo dot I decided to pick one up. This little dot has all the same functionality as the original echo but also allows you the flexibility to connect it to any speaker you want. I like that because I connected it to my super high quality Logitech surround sound system and now it sound 10x better then my original echo for less than half the price. Its able to hear me from a good distance away and almost always understands what I say perfectly.Heres a little bonus feature. It acts as a Bluetooth receiver. I previously had a TP-Link Bluetooth receiver connected to my Logitech speakers so that I could connect my phone wirelessly to play music. Now I dont need that because I can tell Alexa connect to my iPhone and it connects instantly and allows my to stream my music right to it. And for $10 more than the standard Bluetooth receiver I get a world of more functionality.I would highly recommmend the echo dot to anyone considering an echo. Being able to connect it to any speaker is a great feature, Alexa gets smarter every day, and the echo dot even has a decent sounding little speaker in it if you ever need to take it with you somewhere.
Worked fine for 6 months. Used it to listen to NPR and set timers for cooking. On several occations when I tried to cancel the timer it claimed I never set a timer then triggered the timer anyways. A handful of other times it took several minutes of urging to get it to stop the alarm after the timer triggered....Then a colony of ants moved into it. No seriously, there was a queen, eggs, nesting material, and everything. I had to cover it with Raid and then wash it off in the sink. I'm afraid to turn it on because I wasn't able to get all the eggs out of the headphone jack and who knows what ever they left inside it.Amazon says the return window expired back on Jan 31, so I'm probably just going to toss it in the trash. So yes, friends, I regret to inform you that the warranty does not cover ant colonies.
We had one fail on us after almost exactly a year of ownership. It just stopped working. It's past the warranty, obviously, and we hadn't purchased the protection for it through Amazon. The diagnosis based on lazy internet research is that the motherboard needs swapping out. The internets make it sound super easy to do, but the parts are surprisingly difficult to find. Perhaps the takeaway here is that you should always buy the protection? I guess that's a way to view it. I would kind of hope Amazon could make something that would last more than a year for just sitting on a shelf.That said, I did buy two more on Black Friday because they were so cheap. You're reading this, correctly. One broke, so I bought two. I get how that sounds. I won't defend myself, but here's the logic (if you call it that):- I would not have bought again, but I already have a first gen Echo, the big fella, and it works fine. I don't feel like replacing my ecosystem.- Had a not had a working Echo when the dot failed I would not have bought again. Google Home is here, late to market, yes, but a viable option.- I wouldn't have bought at $50. It's too much of a risk for something is at best a convenient substitute for a smart phone.- At $30, they were worth one more shot. If one fails again, I won't be replacing though.That said, when working, the Alexa system is a fairly nice way to smart connect a home. Yes, we can do everything from our phones, but it is really convenient to yell, "Alexa, Santa Claus is coming," and have all the Christmas lights turn on. It can be an exercise in frustration, however as the voice recognition still devolves into a bad rendition of "Who's on First" whenever Alexa decides she really doesn't want to understand me. I've seen my wife screaming at the top of her lungs, "Alexa! Turn on the bedroom light!" to which Alexa responds, "I don't recognize that light". Then I say the same thing, and Alexa says, "Ok".
My husband has the nickname of "Mr. Gadget".  I was surprised that he wasn't overjoyed with the Dot when he got it at Christmas.  He has a Tap that he has used for over a year and really loves it, but when he's in the shower or doing something that his hands are busy, he can't use it completely because of the obvious limitation of needing to touch it first before it becomes hands free..and that 'skill' sometimes turns off after a period of time.So when I told him of what the Dot can do that the Tap can't, he was leery... he evidently loves his Tap more than I thought.But after a week of playing around with the Dot, he sees how it's so much more 'helpful' than the Tap.  The Tap is great because it's portable, cordless when charged, has a rather large span to get a signal (we've used it out in the back yard while having a bar-b-que)... he still uses it in the garage, but has now enjoyed that he can have the Dot in his suite, can get the news, weather, access his calendar, listen to music, etc while he's showering, ironing his shirts, preparing for the day.  We are in the process of getting hubs to have lights and thermostat become 'smart'... so eventually he can be the ruler of his castle via the Dot. ;-)
Its already become a house wide accessory, started with one in the den and home automation, then got one for the kitchen and another for the bedroom. Id be hard pressed to figure out which gets the most use. The kitchen is especially handy setting timers while I cook or adding stuff to the shopping list as I notice Im low on things, then playing my playlists as I clean up. The bedroom is also handy setting a wake up alarm, playing relaxation music, turning off any forgotten lights without having to leave a comfy bed or turning on all the downstairs lights if I hear a noise, the den is good for listening to my daily briefing, playing music, or having Alexa read a book from my library. I also got a kindle fire enabled with Alexa that integrates seamlessly in your home Alexa environment which is helpful if Im in one of the rare hard to hear spots from my established dots. Also audited my bandwidth usage pre and post Alexa, the upload side had an almost negligible increase which was puzzling til I realized my Siri use dropped to zero after getting akexa, so for the tin foil hat crowd screaming about the nsa putting mics in our homes, sorry. Its not giving out a 24/7 audio feed to be recorded stored and evaluated by the government. The added usage per month is about the same as a 3 minute MP3 audio file. No steady audio feeds uploaded.  Maybe if you start talking about bombing something itd trip a red flag and upload that, but to be honest, nowadays if youre sitting at home planning a bombing or shooting, I want the FBI kicking your door in. all in all Alexa has become an invaluable addition to my home.
This Echo Dot I highly recommend for it's lightweight and small has a beautiful shinny black piano finish on it, also very easy to set up and fast acting. I have the Google Home Mini and the Echo Dot both for very different reasons but between the two the Echo Dot wins hands down.PROS AND CONS OF EACH PRODUCT:Echo Dot PROS:Lovely soundVery easy set upCan control from the app very easilyLightweight and smallYou can make Alexa sing to you(ask Alexa to sing you a country song, it's pure comedy I couldn't stop laughing it's a delight)It can easily access your Amazon account for you.Easy to set up reminders and alarms.Google Home Mini PROS:LightweightHas YouTube Red accessDoes load a little faster then the Echo Dot.Echo Dot CONS:Doesn't have YouTube Red accessSpeaker cracks when playing BluetoothCan't hear voice commands through it's cover.Google Home Mini CONS:Very slow set upWants voice recognition for commands but it doesn't recognize your voice.Not sensitive to voice commandsOnly accepts it's Google cord which won't help if you travel and need to bring it.All in all I recommend the Echo Dot as it's the better of the two products and well put together
I like Alexa. I'm one of those people who thinks of something and if I don't write it down I'll forget. Or I'll think oh I'll remember that when I go shopping then forget. So having Alexa is great. I've linked my calendar, lists and music. I linked two dots and one echo. The sound isn't that loud but that's allright. My daughter loves Alexa and asks her silly questions such as " What is your favorite color?" and "Let the cat out of the box" which is a skill we added.It's kinda strange to have my daughter grow up with an AI device but Alexa has helped define words for her. When she is curious about something Alexa helps. She's asked what is a tractor or what is a sneeze and Alexa answers. Alexa has helped family disputes like where certain words come from or who owns what company etc.As for privacy - I know a lot of people are worried about that. Knows Amazon know my spending habits? Sure. My taste in music? YES. But, I like that what I do stays with Amazon. I.E Alexa does not tell me about other products and services I don't need or care about. Oh, and ask Alexa about the daily 5/9 update if your into Mr. Robot.Lastly, I got the smart plug and Alexa turns on and off lights. She's now connected to the harmony hub, so she can turn on and off my TV.
Ive now purchased 3 of these. I was originally looking for a touch enabled bedside lamp for my wife but the mediocre to poor reviews and expense were putting me off. I already had a smart socket connected to Apple HomeKit and was going to purchase a second for this but at $50 each I started looking at alternatives. The offerings compatible with Alexa were less expensive and had higher ratings, which at first disappointed me. Then I came across the echo dot with an offer that included a smart socket. I was a bit reluctant to go outside the Apple ecosystem but boy am I glad I did. Alexa is far superior to Siri. More reliable and accurate.So far Ive paired the sockets, and used them to turn lamps on and off. No need to shout, which I like because it doesnt wake my baby up. Ive also paired with my  ecobee 3 and that works flawlessly - telling it that Im leaving the house, setting the temperature, or resuming the usual schedule.I also really like the drop in (intercom feature). Its nice to just start talking rather than making a phone call that has to be answered on the other end.Most of the sills that Ive seen are not very useful but I do like the npr news skill and a few others.All in all it looks great and works beautifully, and will only get better with time as the AI and skills improve. Amazon are to be congratulated on this one.
There's not much I can add that hasn't been said before, since the Echo Dot is constantly being improved, and anything I say today could be wrong tomorrow.  Mine has been especially poor for movie theater information, but I like it a lot for weather, news, radio, podcasts, and encyclopedia-type questions.  It's even really nice for background music, and seems to have nearly all albums available, including even the Beatles and Stones catalog. The sound quality of the internal speaker is hard to describe, but it's somewhere between, say, a cell phone's speakerphone and a decent Bluetooth speaker or table radio.  There's no bass at all, and little sparkle to the high frequencies, but within its limits, it presents a smooth, un-distorted sound that might exceed your expectations.  The 1/8" headphone jack enables me to connected the Dot to my primary stereo system or to plug in my Shure studio monitor headphones.  It sounds great with either -- or at least as good as 256Kb/sec compressed audio can sound.  If I could add just one feature, the Dot is crying out for cell phone integration.  How cool would it be to be able to announce "Alexa, Call Lilly", and be able to walk around your home hands-free while talking to your friend (as long as she's not named Alexa).  Or to have Alexa announce, "Incoming call from Donald, would you like to accept?" (hint, don't take the call).
Syed Khursheed: Hello, my name is Syed Khursheed. I'm here to help you today.Me: thanks. My Echo Dot does not work anymore. I chatted with a customer rep today and they gave me reset directions. Those failed to make my Echo Dot work. I'd like to send it in for replacement or repair.Syed Khursheed: XXXXX may I know what is the problem with the device?Me: There is no sound coming from the device. The blue lights keep flashing. I could not even reset it. There was no orange light.Syed Khursheed: Alright, a member of our Echo Tech Support will be the perfect person to help you with this. I will be transferring this chat, this will only take a moment.Me: I know how it works. I have been using it fine for many months, and now it does not work.A Customer Service Associate will be with you in a moment.You are now connected to Amazon from Amazon.comAmazon: Hello, my name is Praneetha. Please give me a moment to review the previous correspondence.Me: Ok.Amazon: Im afraid, it seems that your device has malfunctioned and needs a replacement.As you might be aware, your Echo dot comes with 90-days limited warranty which ended on January 19, 2017, I'm unable to process a free replacement.However, I'm happy to give you options of replacing at a discounted price. Would you like to see the option?Me: Hmm, I thought the warranty was for a year!?Amazon: Unfortunately it is only for 90-daysMe: Could you please look at this Amazon warranty webpage? Echo dot is listed under 1 yr warranty items. https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201014520Amazon: That is Echo dot 1st generation [my name] and your's is 2nd generation deviceMe: What...so 2nd generation is built worse than the 1st??? Very disappointing. what is the discounted replacement price?Amazon: Please check below link:https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&nodeId;=201854160Amish, it is not that it's worstThe policy is set by the companyYou can purchase the same device at 15% offMe: That's fine. I really didn't want to spend that much more money for something that works less than a year. I will certainly tell everyone about this 90 day warranty. :(Amazon: Most devices never have this issue. The likelihood of this ever happening again to a Echo dot you own is significantly low.Me: Thank you for your kind words.Amazon: Also I understand your concern. However, as per the warranty policy of the Company, I'd be unable to process a free replacement after warranty has passed. I hope you understand my limitations regarding this.Me: Thats fine. Its not your fault. Thanks anyway.Amazon: I am very sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations this time around. I hope that you will allow us another opportunity to serve you in the future.
This is a great little device! It has may features including reminders, alarms, playing music, creating lists, etc. It was very easy to setup and connect to my Wi-Fi. The small speaker on the Dot is sufficient. Listening to music is clear. Just don't expect to be able to listen to loud music for parties, etc. You'll want the regular Echo for that purpose. But the Echo Dot is a steal for under $30. Get it while you can for this price. I just bought a second one.I also bought a smart outlet that's Alexa compatible and now I can tell Alexa to turn the light on and off that's plugged into that outlet. You can basically control any electrical device that you plug into these smart outlets. I know they also have smart lightbulbs, but I believe they require a hub to work with Alexa. There was no hub necessary when using this smart switch. You just have to be able to plug in the light. Surprisingly, very simple setup.The one thing that surprised me is that you can't set up a reoccurring reminder with Alexa (she says "I can't do that yet"). This probably means someone is working on this, as the reminder feature was recently added. That would definitely be a huge improvement as it relates to the reminder functions. I have only just scratched the surface of its capabilities. And there are new things being added every day.
Oh, man, do I LOVE this Echo Dot!  I didn't think I would get a lot of use out of one and couldn't really see why I would want it other than its a cool tech toy.  I am happy to report I was wrong!  I use this ALL THE TIME!  I especially love this when I want to cook a specific type of dinner and can just say "Alexa give me directions for..." and then name the meal you want to cook.  I use this for my alarm clock and for reminders of things I need to do.I especially like that I can just say "Call (whomever I want to call) and it will start to call that person - works exactly like a speaker.  It's so convenient.  I am now just starting to buy the electronics that can go with this like lightbulbs.  I can say: Turn on the light in the hallway, or kitchen or wherever I need a light on and BAM light goes on!I have it so it will play all my favorite music just by saying "Play my playlist".  There is so much more this device can do and I have only just begun to scratch the surface.  As I learn more about this I will try to update my review.All I can say is - if you are thinking of buying one but not sure if you would use it I say GET IT.  You WILL use it for so many things.  There is a website that gives you a whole list of things you can do with the Echo.  I'm still learning and love everything about this little device.
Not what I expected.  Slow . Not enough phrase words. Have to talk to it multiple times to get answer.  Not worth the money. Hope they have an up date. Was so excited but got so disappointed.
I picked up one of these devices when it was bundled with the TP Link smart plug.  I haven't used the smart plug yet, but immediately plugged the echo Dot in and  I have to say I'm quite impressed!  Within about 10 minutes of minimal configuration through the Android app I was able to ask Alexa a ton of questions and set up an alarm.  The next morning I got up and asked Alexa about the news and it played for me a synopsis through Reuters of what was going on in world.I haven't gone through all of the features, but I eventually hooked it up to a set of etekcity smart plugs I already had and have been able to control lights and other devices and my house right from Alexa.  The light configuration is a bit tricky and shaky at times but that has nothing to do with Alexa.  From my minimal use of the device, it's very clear to see that this is the future of technology.  I can't wait to see where this goes and look forward to configuring Alexa to do a whole lot more.It's very easy to see why the echo Dot was the top selling item for Christmas last year.  Amazon got a winner in their hands with this device.
The Alexa line of products still leads the way in functionality over Google home in my opinion. There are pros and cons comparisons that can be made between the two but Amazon wins hands down for now.. If you are looking to get started in home automation, you can't go wrong with an Alexa and TP-link products (They offer the best functionality value for the price point in my honest opinion). If you are looking for an actual Bluetooth speaker to pair with your phone or as a standalone player using Spotify or Amazon Music, then for sound quality go with Dot's big brother, the Echo, ( I recommend sticking with the Echo 1st gen if you can get it, as the sound quality is much better than the 2nd gen.)If you own Sonos Bluetooth speakers then you can pair them with the Dot and control your music.The Dot is more suited as a nightstand device that can be used to play you soothing music to go to sleep too (you can set a sleep timer) or as an alarm clock to wake you up. It can give you a roundup of news, traffic, and weather as well as calendar reminders before you step out of the door.I am knocking off 1 banana due to the fact that Amazon needs to sharpen up the AI just a little, I noticed that the Google home can keep a conversation thread going which the Amazon product cannot. You can ask the second question about a subject without having to mention the subject again (for example Q1: Who is Obama, Q2: How old is he?, you do not have to say Obama in Q2 but Google home knows whom you are talking about)Having tested both platforms for some time, I Prefer the Amazon product.Techchimp Rating: 4 BananasPros:Price point (1)Ease in Pairing (1)Skillsets (1)Function (1)Cons:Needs AI work
Works great!  You can set it next to your bed and use it for an alarm clock as long as it is linked to the internet.  You can tell it to play what ever music you like to sleep by and for how long or you can set it to play a thunderstorm or rain sounds or the sounds of waves at the beach!  You can set it to give you a brief up date of the news and weather and traffic through Reuters online.  Of course you can order accessories like lights and other gadgets that it will control remotely at your command.  This speaker doesn't get loud like the echo but it is quality sound.  It's limited on the information it can give out.  I asked it to recite the preamble to the constitution and it ponied right up but I asked it to recite the Gettysburg address and it couldn't do it...just that it was a 3 minute speech given by President Lincoln.  Well worth the money...can't see anybody going wrong with this.
Although Echo Dot isn't available in most of Europe, I bought one when I the US and brought it wth me to Spain where I reside. Some the Echo Dot features don't transfer, such as controlling the lights, appliances or ordering pizza from Dominos, the device really is magnificent.If others are considering connecting the device, it's important to know that you might need to change your billing location in the Google Play Store in order to download the Alex app on your phone (Amazon and Google tech support had to walk me through those steps) and a plug adapter is necessary. The Echo Dot requires a 9 volt input, so a regular cell phone plug probably isn't adequate. The plug adapter is quite inexpensive (2.50 euros) and solves the plug problem. I then had some trouble getting Echo Dot connected to my home wifi network. I tried at a friend's house, and at work, and there wasn't any trouble, so there was something wrong with my home wifi. The Amazon support team was very helpful in trying to resolve my issue. There were lots of phone calls and troubleshooting, and I have only positive things to say about the support received. The problem was not with Amazon, or the Echo Dot; it was with my internet service provider (ISP). It turns out that different wifi channels are used in Europe than in the US. My ISP had to open up some more channels on my router in order for the Echo Dot to find my network. Once that was done, problem solved.  It's possible to change the time zone of the device, so Alexa does know the correct day and time, but the other location information has only US options (city and state). I haven't tried to change the location because I can just ask for the weather information specifying my city, and Alexa knows. I especially enjoy the connection to Amazon music (only 3.99 per month) and have connected one device to my sound bar speaker, and another Echo Dot device to a Bluetooth portable speaker so I can listen to my flash briefing (different news sources you can select in the App) while I'm getting ready in the morning. If you're considering bringing Alexa to Europe, know it's possible, but there are some adjustments necessary.Compared to the Google alternative, the Echo Dot price can't be beat, and connecting to speakers is a great advantage. I'm sure the "Skills" the Echo Dot can do and Alexa's knowledge will only continue to grow.
So I really like my dot. That being said I do wish there was some added functionality. I do appreciate that Amazon has allowed us to choose between several name options, however, these are very limited. I have Alexa (the echo) already... we use Alexa as the wake word.  Even though they say your voice should be picked up by the closest "Alexa" I found that not to be the case in my situation. I changed my dot's wake word to "echo " (confused yet?) Since the other option was "Amazon " which would be way too confusing, and probably turn on too much... and computer which wouldn't be a great option but turns out might be my only option.Come to find out that the wake word echo is too similar to a whole lot of other words. So we are always waking echo dot up. It appears that echo dot is also very sensitive compared to my echo Alexa .. Even switching the 2 locations shows dot to be super responsive and hear everything versus the echo Alexa not hearing as well ..I Think I need to get one of those books about what you can do with the echos... Because I thought there was a way to keep them fairly separate... but I won't go into too much detail here until I read the book... them come back and ask help from the awesome Amazon community if I'm still stuck!!I love dot, wish I could name her dotty, or something ! I have severe ADD, as in it was ruining my sanity, and I imagine others, it is so bad. I've been taking medications and trying to surround myself with tools to support focus and time tracking.For those with ADD I suggest something like this.  It provides us with a solution for keeping us focused and reminding us about tasks. I can work on something and say "echo set timer for five min " Then work knowing I won't become hyperfocused and lose track of time. When the alarm goes off I can easily tell her to set it for another 5, or just move onto something else.  Setting reminders to take meds, complete tasks, make phone calls, send messages to other Echo owners, add things to my shopping list, order things directly (I ordered dot from my Alexa on prime day for a lovely discount!) The list goes on.  Being able to play my music is nice but I will really like when I can say "Alexa play song or playlist from spotify"... that's just a fun request tho... lolSo she helps me a lot, I'm an artist so I'm often working with fire or things that make my hands mucky, so having a Phillips hue bridge and lights had been super helpful. Just annoying that when the power goes out I have problems getting the two to talk again. That could be anyone's fault tho, Amazon, Phillips, well... not mine of course... sheesh...(ok maybe mine)So I'm happy, she's helpful...i have a bunch off things on my wish list I would love to see in the future, like interfacing with my Google stuff (Google keep is my other sanity saving ADD tool that my non ADD bf got me hooked on... the world could be mine if the Googles and the Amazons played well together! Oh the sanity I would have!! Alas only time will tell what new cool things Alexa will learn...Let's start small... let me name her dotty! 
Voice recognition not as good as expected. Sensitivity to commands seems to vary. Often receive incorrect results having to repeat commands. iHeart Radio and Tunein stations drop connections frequently. Customer service quick to respond but did not admit to software issue and suggested reset which did not resolve problem. Would not recommend purchase until software has been more refined.UPDATE JULY 16, 2017Have used this thing for 7 months now. It never got any better. Drops connection (5 feet from router w/20Mb cable), drop-outs and "hick-cups" when streaming radio. I attempted voice training with NO improvement. Today would not connect to server for over an hour. Triby connected ok so issue is not my wifi. Dot has hardware and software problems that are not being addressed by amazon. 90 day warranty should be longer.UPDATE JULY 26, 2017Frequency of dropouts and disconnects continues to increase. Have reconfirmed dot malfunction: Triby plays streams while dot is experiencing dropouts.
My wife got me an Echo for Christmas and I was so impressed with it that I got a Dot. So the Echo is on the living room and the Dot in the master bedroom. I like using both as an intercom system.The Dot is good as an intercom and for information but it really needs some kind of external speaker for music because the Dot wasn't designed for that. I got an iHome for it and it's really nice; music sounds great now.Just be careful because you can get addicted to the all of its possibilities. I just installed two smart light switches last night for both the porch and living room lights. I already installed two smart plugs for two lamps in different parts of the house. Being able to control the lights verbally in the house of through the Alexa app remotely is just awesome.I have a different reminder for my daughter for every weekday depending on what after school activity she had that day (i.e. "Pack your leotard for ballet"). I also have Alexa turn on lights every night and then turn them off in the morning.This is just a great setup.
The Echo Dot is great for smaller rooms like offices, bathrooms or bedrooms. You still get all the functionality of Alexa without having a large echo or tap unit as an eye sore in the room. You do lose volume with the smaller Dot but in a smaller space it doesn't really make a difference.If you buy this make sure to take advantage of the Alaxa newsletter so you get all of the new (they add stuff every week) functionality and apps out of it. Also take a look at the app wiki so you can activate all the stuff you will actually use.
(Two week user)  I purchased this to be able to ask questions and find information, trivia, etc.  I think it lacks in it's ability to find information.  I thought it would navigate the internet looking for information that is there.  Instead it appears only to search limited informational data.  It is able to find many subjects but when asking questions, Alexa responds with the answer about 1/3 to half the time. I anticipate that the knowledge base will increase.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  The voice recognition is mostly accurate, but depending on the word or words you use it can be frustrating getting the correct recognition.  So far I am not into using the smart home features.  I noticed difficulty in finding a particular song, instead if Alexa knows the artist it will play a random selection of songs.  If you want the song to stop, I have go very close to the speaker for it to recognize my voice.  I would recommend that you get an extra speaker if you want to listen to good quality music. The speaker is a little tinny.  Also we live in a small town and I have asked for a weather forecast several times.  It only gives current weather and the days forecast and isn't able to give  tomorrow's forecast. or an extended forcast.  It keeps trying to give me the closest large cities forecast and I haven't found a way for it to recognizemy specific location as you can do when you set a browser up to give weather forecasts for you location.  Don't get me wrong, it can be a useful device and does do quite a bit and the price was very reasonable on sale.  Again, maybe my expectations were too high.  I will update when I have have used more features.Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black
So... I own both the tower and now several dots.  Of course the dots are more reasonably priced, however, the speaker ability is really where it's vastly different.  Obviously the tower is much better in the speaker department.  However, I did find that there is a cordless speaker you can buy to go with your 2nd gen dot that is an improvement and still at lower price point than the tower when combined with the cost of the dot. (Mokcao cordless speaker - amazon sells it too) Because the dots are so reasonably priced we have them in all 3 major rooms and use the cordless speaker to drop one dot in and take it outside to our sunroom when we like.  Over all, I am pleased with both my tower AND dots... but probably will stick to dot purchases in the future because of the price point.  I would say if you've been on the fence, the dot is well worth a try.  It's very easy to set up, you will need to download the app, also easy to follow step by step setups.  Once you're hooked up you will be amazed at how often you use Alexa.  At our house she helps me keep track of where I am supposed to be every day... timers... night time meditation... the occasional argument and even plays games with us as well as much needed comedic relief.  It may not be "necessary" to have Alexa, but I am always surprised at how often we use her assistance.  It's nice and worth it to us.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.
I got my Echo Dot for Christmas and I am loving it!!! I've had my eye on a white noise machine on amazon for about a year and it was $50.00. We have some very noisy neighbors behind us that party regularly until 2-3 am. A friend talked me into the Dot because she told me how you could use it as a noise machine. Well, when the dot went from $50.00 to $29.99 after Thanksgiving, I told my husband he had to get it for me because it was already cheaper than the white noise machine and I could choose different sounds as well, plus play music on it! Well on Christmas morning when I opened it, I found so much functionality from it, that I decided to toss my old alarm clock! The light from the clock always makes it hard to fall asleep anyways. I am a very light sleeper, but I have been sleeping like a baby since I got this Echo Dot! As a serial snoozer, I also like that to stop or snooze the alarm, I have to speak to Alexa which ends up making me wake up more than just pressing a button. If you're on the fence about trying the Amazon Echo line out, you can't go wrong with an Echo Dot. The only slightly negative I've experienced is the speaker can sound a little "tinny" when playing music, but for my bedroom that is fine. The ambient noises for sleeping all sound great! We also ended up grabbing up an Echo at the sale price of $79.99 and that speaker really has some bang to it! So, if you're looking to play a lot of music on it, I'd go with the Echo. But if you're looking for a replacement for an alarm clock or sound in a smaller room like a bedroom, I'd go with the Echo Dot. You can also connect them together and play music throughout your house (everywhere that you have an Echo/Echo Dot).
I bought the Echo Dot with a Sonos promotion because I love our Sonos system and was excited to control it using alexa.  My two favorite things, sonos and amazon.  Before I get to that...start by saying our family of seven really like alexa and this is our first one. It works as it should.  From creating shopping lists, getting motivating quotes of the day, weather, setting cooking timers, reordering from amazon, etc.  Easy to use and fun and she understands commands even if someone says it differently than another. Of course every time I say "alexa" I think of the South Park episode.  For Sonos, I can't get it to work right.  I thought I could play my sonos playlists and my favorites, but alexa says she can't find them. I have amazon music, but I had the impression it was going to fully integrate with Sonos. I have two speakers and I set up a group, but I can't get it to work more than one time without completely losing it after I tell alexa to stop the music. I'm getting tired of unplugging and plugging, turning settings on and off, so I'm going to patiently wait for what I hope will be a future software update that will make it work as it should.  At this point, alexa no longer plays music through sonos at all, because while sonos was playing, I asked alexa to do something and it interfered with sonos somehow.  Again not going to waste more time trying to troubleshoot. I know there is the Sonos one coming out, but I won't buy until the bugs are worked out.
The Echo Dot is a great little device. I got it because I like technology and wanted to test it out. I'm pleasantly surprised and using it more than I had planned. I'm an Amazon Prime member so playing music is as simple as saying "Alexa, play some smooth Jazz" and it plays from my Amazon music. What turned out to be a nice surprise is the Echo will also play many local radio stations using the Tunein Radio app. I start every day now with "Alexa, what is the forecast for today" followed by "Alexa, play 90.9 WBUR" (NPR radio station).The Echo's ability to recognize your voice and translate correctly is amazing. At first I was yelling commands until I realized you just need to speak in a normal voice.The only drawback is that the Echo cannot do web searches. It uses the Bing search engine and you cannot change it to Google or Yahoo (at least without jumping through hoops) so 99% of the time the response to a search is something like "I don't know how to do that". It's hard to believe they would tie themselves into Microsoft so much that they won't even let the user decide what search engine they want to use. Because of this I can only give the Echo four stars and I rely on Siri to add reminders, add items to my shopping list, and handle anything to do with web searching. At least with Siri I can say "Search Google/Yahoo for <fill in the blank>" and get results.The Dot is a great device, a lot of fun, and the sound surprised me considering it is just coming from a little box.
Have enjoyed The Echo dot (have 2) and the Echo (have 1) for the most part.  However, I have not been able to play any of "My playlists" from my Amazon music account on any of my devices.  I can play from "Followed Playlists".  Have checked all the settings in the Alexa app, and the device settings.  Have worked with Echo support and talked for 1.5 hours with no results.  Too bad because everything else I have tried seems to work fine.  Can turn on/off TV and control it and its components, can turn on/off lights etc. I have read customer feedback on the Amazon Echo user forum and found others are having similar issues with playlists.  I tried their suggestions on how to address Alexa to play music from "My Playlists" that I created, but nothing works.Maybe Amazon can figure out what is happening and find a solution.  Would love to give it a 5 star rating but for now will stick with 4.UPDATE: December 29.  Took a chance and called Echo support again.  Got a different CSR who was able to resolve the issue in several minutes.  Didn't change anything on my end.  It was something they did on their side.  MAGIC!  I guess??  Thanks Amazon Echo support!
I  love this device and even without a smart home around it, the scheduling and the tasks, alarms, the games, makes it well worth having.This would be a 5-star review if it weren't for the fact that adding this device this month to our household actually took us over our data limit for the internet. We get 1.2TB a month, and we average around 850GB a month between four adults, two of whom are active gamers. All I did aside from using it as a talkative calendar and scheduler was play Spotify during the day and Sleep Sounds at night, and we hit the data limit and then went over for the first time ever.Got it November 15. By November 30th, we had exceeded our data limit. I'm not sure what the exact numbers are, since Cox won't disclose the figures exactly, but it can show us which device consumed the most data via wifi in the house, and Alexa Echo Dot Gen 2 was at the very top of the list, beating out my roommate who is a professional gamer and legit plays games 16 hours a day. I learned something real darn quick--the Echo Dot is actively using the wifi even when YOU aren't using the Echo Dot. It is burning through data even when it is doing "nothing" and waiting for you to use it. Pretty much, if it's on, it's burning data.
Initially I was very impressed by the Echos. I have a substantial investment in Echo devices. I have an original echo, 5 dots, the scanner stick thingy  and a Tap. It seems lately that Alexa has a very hard time hearing. She lights up when she hears her voice and then immediately turns off. Then she mishears what I am saying in totally improbable ways. she can't answer very rudimentary questions AND she she keeps on saying things like TP Link isn't responding and "a few things share this name" when I'm trying to turn smart plugs on and off even though there is nothing that has a name that is anywhere even close. Conversely I have one of the competitions devices in my house and it seems like I can be literally ANYWHERE and it hears exactly what I say and answers correctly about 95% of the time. Alexa is correct about 30% of the time. No, I don't speak with an accent. I speak clear US english. I bought 3 more of the competition for myself for Christmas. I'm all but scrapping all of my Alexas except for the Tap. I will probably keep one Echo installed in the house just in case I want to buy something but otherwise I'm decommissioning the rest of the units and giving them away.
Although setting it up reminded me of the beginning of a "Black Mirror" episode, it's extremely nice to be able to walk into my apartment, say "Alexa, I'm home", and have my overhead light turn on. It's also really nice to be able to say, "Alexa, shuffle my favorite playlist in Spotify". The cross-device connection is really amazing and it works very well. It's also really nice to be able to say "Alexa, why are my friends becoming more distant and why do I find it difficult to connect intimately with my significant other?" The possibilities are endless.Seriously, though, it's a great little device that makes my life a lot easier. It has a very good range and one is perfect for my small apartment. It has very accurate "hearing" abilities as well. The price is more than worth it for the extra ease and comfort.I'd definitely recommend AGAINST buying this if you don't have any sort of smart home devices (like a Wi-Fi plug, Bluetooth speaker, Philips Hue system, or a Nest thermostat). If you don't have some sort of device to connect it to, it's not much more than a very good Siri.
I had purchased 3 dots after I had originally purchased the "Echo".  We purchased these guys to have in multiple rooms - primarily for my place of business.  The primary intention was that we wanted a nice solution to getting music into multiple rooms at our place of work.  Everything worked fine until...... Amazon decided that they were going to start blocking access to Amazon prime streaming services playing on more than 2 players at one time.  The entire point of Amazon promoting the dot was to get these devices into as many rooms as possible in your home or place of work.  With the single best feature now gone - I can tell you that we are extraordinary upset.  This is the first time I am writing a review, ever.  I'm logging in to simply inform people of the bait and switch tactics that Amazon has now sunk down to.  The other major downside of this device is simply how many times it turns on, tells you that it didn't understand you, all without ever prompting the thing to turn on.The positive for the Echo is the great sound quality.  Easily beats out any Bose product in a great compact design.  We simply wish that Amazon would continue it's original policy of allowing people to stream to multiple devices - after all, you PAID for it!
I really don't know what all the fuss is about. I know Amazon wants me to have one of these in every room but I don't have (and don't want) a lot of "smart" stuff. I thought it would be useful with Amazon Music but either Alexa usually isn't bright enough to find the song I want by the artist I want, or I'm not bright enough to give the instructions properly. I also don't like it, which I didn't find out until after purchasing it, that a record of everything you say to this machine is kept by Amazon. I suppose that's how artificial intelligence gets developed, but I don't like it. I also find that its range for hearing commands is much smaller than advertised. If I'm not sitting right next to it I have to yell loudly to get its attention. Most of the "skills" available are junk that random people have put out there and it's a pain to find the ones that have any value at all. The best one I've found is one from Audobon that plays bird calls.  It'd be nice if Amazon would weed out the crap. It did pair easily with my Bose SoundLink speaker and if you want to play everything by some artist in no particular order, it's great.  It works well for reminders and things like that...if you have it plugged in and are there at the time of the reminder. I'm sure it doesn't have a battery because Amazon wants you to have one in every room.  I didn't realize when I bought it that there's no battery and that sucks but my fault for not noticing that before I bought it. I bought it on Prime Day for $34. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. I guess I should read some other reviews to see what other people are using it for.
I don't hold back when I love something from Amazon, so I'll be just as plain-spoken on this. We just don't love this product. Chasing down "talents" for it is a bore, and you have to remember code words and sequences, and about the only thing my husband uses it for now is to play Jeopardy, and to get it to fart. Right after I bought this for my husband, my son taught us how to use the "okay Google" feature on our phones, and we use that multiple times a day, while Alexa sits unloved and unused. If you're looking for something that's incredibly easy and user friendly, I can't recommend this. The set up was a total pain, and had to be done about ten times before it took...over and over, using the exact same instructions, until finally, it magically worked. I wanted so much for this to be something useful for my husband, but it's just not.
We have an Alexa and two echo dots. We've had these for almost a year now. The Alexa is great, no complaints overall. The dot, however, needs some improvement on Amazon's development side. My daughter's dot won't tell the correct temperature and weather, and even with troubleshooting the settings, we aren't able to fix it. That's all the issues we have as far as functionality.Regarding the system itself, Amazon's development would do well to think about the dot and work outside the box in the next phase of development. Like, why is the dot not sold as a true portable unit? I bought my second dot for my husband to travel with for work. It's impossible to set it up on hotel WiFi and a real pain. The other thing is, with it being small and seemingly portable, why are the dots not completely wireless? Should have a rechargeable base and be able to take it with you anywhere in the house and beyond. This is simple tech at this point and should be easy to implement. I hope they fix this, because as of right now, the dot is pretty useless. I get it, you want people to buy one for every room. Being greedy shouldn't supersede making a great product, however, and it lends to your line of thinking when you develop your products. Profit over all other things. I won't be buying anymore echo dots. Thanks.
We have 2 echos and 6 dots.  They are amazing! We use them as intercoms to communicate throughout the house (almost 4k sq ft). I can use it from my phone or from any room in the house to "drop in" on whatever room I need to.  I can then talk to the kids without having to yell for them.  I also use it to make my shopping lists, set timers for cooking, ask measurements conversions, and I love to use it to listen to my books on audible. The multiple echos and dots work together as a whole house speaker system as well.  I can play Christmas music in every room simultaneously while we decorate.Each child has their own that they can use for music, stories, games, and even an alarm clock.  They ask the weather before getting dressed, set reminders to do their chores or homework, set timers to know when their turn is over, and tons of other things. My kids also use it to assist with homework by asking how to spell a word or what a word means.  They add new stuff all the time and there are hundreds of skills you can enable.Oh if you are worried about what your kids ask it, there is a history section in the app where you can review what they ask or say. You can also delete history on it as well.
The Echo Dot was a gift from our daughter and at first we looked at it like a device from another planet.  What's it do?  Do we really need it?We have our answers.  It's a handy little doodad that's fun to have around.  We constantly ask it questions ("Alexa, am I good looking?") and give it chores ("Alexa, set timer for 12 minutes") which she performs flawlessly.  I'll even ask her to play music, but because we haven't signed up for an Amazon music service she flounders more often than not.  What she does play sounds good as clarity and volume has never been a problem.We've thanked our daughter and her family for a marvelous gift.  In fact. I bought another for my computer room.p.s. - Alexa thinks I look great!!!
The Amazon Echo Dot is a great little tool to help put you on the path to home automation. There is no end to the things you can do and control with the Echo Dot.  II broke by back and neck so sometimes it's difficult to get up out of bed.  I use my in to voice control my Belkin WeMo switches with just my voice.  I also use it to stream music from my phone and play media on my tv.  But it is the simple little things I like the most.  Like saying, "Alexa, what's the weather going to be like today?" or "Alexa, give me my news briefing."  or, "Alexa, what movies are playing at the local theater."  or even, "Alexa, what time is it?"You can link to accounts like Pandora or Spotify and ask Alexa to play just about anything.  If you can't remember the name of a song, you can say, "Alexa, what's the name of the song that says, 'She was dancing down the street with her suede-blue eyes. . ." and Alexa will find it and play it. Alexa get's smarter the more you use her.  And unlike other electronic devices that seem to be obsolete the day after you guy them, the Amazon Echo Dot is designed in such a way that it can update itself and integrate new technologies as they come along.  Kudos to Amazon for making it easy enough for beginners to comfortably use, yet function rich enough to satisfy even the most tech savvy customer.
I would theoretically like this device, however, we discovered the hard way that it eats a ton of internet data. Our only option for internet is Hughes Satellite and we have a monthly data cap of 50gb a month. We were forced to purchase multiple data add ons. I would not figure out what was eating the data. Finally, I change the Wifi network name on our router and through process of elimination discovered that the echo was sucking our data dry. Supposedly, it only uses a minimal amount of data when in idle mode. This is simply not true.
We have several Kindles in the Fire version and several older iPods.  We have a Bose Bluetooth speaker which works with every device we have.  This Echo Dot does not work with any device we have.  I was finally able for our iPods to connect but the Echo Dot could not recognize any of the playlists on the pods.  The only use for this Echo Dot is to buy more items from Amazon without using your Kindle.  I don't need anything more from Amazon.
I purchased the Echo Dot and the Google Home Mini around the same time.  I keep them both in the living room with me depending on what your primary use is, they have different strengths.  I ask Alexa something, she can't answer, I ask Google home the same and she answers.  Music that plays on one free costs money with the other.I don't use smart outlets so I don't have them controlling my home, I'm sure they both do that equally well with one caveat.  Alexa's microphone and speaker are superior to Google Home Mini's so I'd think Alexa hearing you to turn something on would be better, you can be across the room or in the next room and Alexa hears you.  You have to be on top of the Google Home Mini for her to respond.So they have different features, different strengths and weaknesses that means I want both near me in the main room of my house.  I will probably buy another of each and keep the google home in my room and Alexa near my kids room for the intercom like features it has and listening capabilities that are stronger in Alexa (Echo dot).  I honestly can't pick a favorite.The number 1 super annoying thing about both of these is when a commercial comes on for either, they wake up and try to respond to the TV.  I don't feel like changing the wake up words so I'd say a full out ban of saying Alexa or Hey Google on TV is warranted.  ;)
A fun gadget, but the jury is still out on how useful it actually is. I moved over a month ago and although I unpacked my Echo Dot, I haven't actually bothered plugging it back in. And frankly, I haven't missed it once.The biggest thing I wanted out of my Echo Dot was to play music. I had no problems syncing it with my Bluetooth speaker or my Spotify account. However, Alexa doesn't recognize the names of half my Spotify playlists. Some she can play fine, but others she has no idea what I'm asking of her and just starts playing the last song I was listening to instead. There's also no way to ask her to play all of the songs in my library on shuffle, which is how I listen to my music 99% of the time. This is probably a Spotify issue and no fault of Amazon, but it's still disappointing since this was my primary reason for buying it.It's convenient to ask Alexa questions instead of Googling them, but this seems more like a fun gimmick rather than something that's genuinely making my life easier. Plus you have to over-enunciate everything for her to understand you. I bought a video doorbell and a few smart electric plugs which I haven't set up yet, so maybe I'll find Alexa more useful once those are up and running. But for now, while I find her fun, I don't find her terribly useful.
I am an audiophile and am amazed at the good fidelity that can be obtained with the new Echo Dot II.  One of your reviewers suggested a direct cable connection to the speakers vs. Bluetooth is better.  I normally agree but can not hear any differnce using the Bose Mini Soundlink II speakers.  That combination far outperforms the larger Echo for fidelity. (I undrestand there will be a new Echo with improved speakers next year.)  Bluetooth has improved so much in the last 5 years I am beginning to ignore my collections of  CD's and LP's.I am so impressed with the Echo Dot II that I will order 2-3 more.  The price is a steal for what it will do.  Setup and pairing is easy. The Alexa app. works with both the Echo and the Echo Dot.  The access to good music from several excellent sources makes it unecessary to search through my CD and LP collection.If you have a decent pair of bluetooth speakers, I suggest pairing with the Echo Dot. It creates a great sound system.  Even alone the speaker in the Dot is OK. But for the price you can't do better.
I love my Amazon Echo Dot! Got one for Christmas and was so excited to set it up! I have a Magic Home bluetooth lightbulb which works great (3 step process to set it up) easily connected my Spotify account, and added a couple of fun skills (weather, dream-machine noises, comedy central, NPR, horoscope, etc.) and use it everyday! It's most handy when I first wake up and groggily say 'Alexa stop!' and the alarm fades away, then I listen to the weather and get a flash briefing on what's new in the news while I get ready for work, maybe ask her to play a song to pep me up. Then at night I ask her to turn the lights on (though I've noticed a bit of lag from the Magic Home lighbulb, not Echo's fault, it happens with Magic Home Android app too) and am planning on getting another BT lightbulb for my overhead room-light-fixture. Overall this is a great product, the sound quality is great for such a little thing, after doing the initial voice set up, Alexa understands me even when I'm dozing off and slurring my words, asking her to turn the lights off. :)
OK, I have no home automation, and I am sure there will be those who will say I'm not using half of it's potential, but this thing stands alone as an excellent audio accessory.  I have it hooked up to my 1970's Marantz and I love it (LAAGIE 2-PACK 3.5mm to AV RCA Audio Adapter Cable for Ipod/MP3/pc 1.8m,3.5 mm Mini to RCA Stereo Audio Cable).  I pay the $3.99 a month for the Amazon Music app and it has yet to be stumped.  They have some cool playlists and channels but you can have it play an album if you want.  Playing the album "Just as I am" by Bill Withers right now.  Beats the heck out of the radio any day.Having it turn my lights on or off does nothing for me.  I already have these devices on the wall near the doorways that perform that function with a touch.  I am considering getting a couple of the outlets to go with it before the next time I go out of town, the "random lights" feature sounds useful.Linked it to to my Amazon Fire, don't see what it does that the remote does not.One star off for the fact that it is a very music centric device, with an alarm function, yet you can't have it wake you to music.  Really?Not really my experience, but an acquaintance has an Aunt who is nearly blind and loves 30's-40's band music.  He tried several devices before he came upon the Echo which she can handle on her own and she loves it.  I can see this being a godsend for disabled people.
We are very happy with our Echo Dots (5), Full size Echo, and the Echo Show. We also purchased an additional Dot for my 91 year old grandmother. The recent update making it possible to "drop in" and open the microphone in any room where there is an Alexa product has been wonderful! Not only can I drop in and check on Nana but I can also keep an ear out for my kids and dogs no matter where i am--even from work! We use our Dots in every bedroom and use them each night for background noise, classical music, or audible books. The List feature is super handy as well. I can stand at the fridge or in my pantry and add items to the shopping list rather than having to write it down. The phone app also updates at real time so if my husband thinks of something while I'm in the store he can add it and it pops right up! We've also installed a Nest thermostatNest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexathat links to the Alexas--especially nice on cold PA mornings when you want to stay in bed until the heat kicks on. :) We plan on adding additional Alexa compatible as well...Just having a hard time deciding where to start!My only complaint is that you can't change her name from Alexa or Computer.  My husband works in IT so we say computer A LOT in our house. LOL! We've all taken to whispering or pointing in her direction when we don't actually want her to do something.
This is awesome!  Hard part is realizing you don't have to SHOUT at it.  Creapily enough... she can hear you from the other room.  That also means, she's listening and recording EVERYTHING you say, and i mean everything.  There will be, can be, no secrets.  :0  Keep that in mind.  I figured though uncle sam is already listening to everything you say from every laptop, every ipad, every tablet, every phone and most TV's now, in addition to voice activated remotes.  So... what's one more thing?  LOLWe did want to try this though and i'm glad i did.  It's cool.  There's lots of apps that expand what you can ask of Alexa.  I'm not to the point yet of making grocery lists, using it for cooking and ordering stuff, but it's super easy for listening to music and finding stations and answering questions where you'd normally have to go out to Google to find.I read with one in different rooms you can also use them as walkie talkies.  I have not gotten that far yet but i look forward to it.  I'm now waiting for Christmas when they go on sale again so i can get at least 2 more.  One for each room.  I'm that impressed.  It's a lot of fun.Remember though... keep 1 room in your home technology free so you can talk in private.  We found the bathroom works best, when it's time to shower.  Only place to discuss finances and other sensitive things because again... we know someone's listening, just not who.Love alexa!  lol
In love with Alexa she's my new best friend!
I have 3 dots and one large Echo. I really love them most of the time but this ongoing issue with one has made me not want to purchase or recommend to others if you plan to use as an alarm. We have two alarms set on one of the Echos every weekday. About 50% of the time, my dot will not turn off during the second alarm, it just continues to beep and you can only stop it by unplugging it. The other 50% of the time, both alarms work good. I have called and chatted with Amazon 3 times with the last call a promise to let me know how what they were doing to address the situation. Since there has been no follow-up I can't recommend buying this if you plan to use it for dual alarms.
This review is about the Amazon Echo Dot. I was really disappointed after setting it up, the volume is horrible you cant hear nothing, Amazon solution is to connect or pair a speaker to it, well i dont have a speaker that I can use for that. Another issue is the fact that they want us to pay more to be able to play music on each echo device. I already had amazon music for my echo but  they want more to be able to play music in each echo.
Last week I told a co-worker I was interested in buying an Echo Dot.Him: "I've seen those. What would you use it for?"Me: "I don't know."Him: "A couple people in my unit purchased one. They said the same thing."So I placed the Dot on my Wish List. There it remained until the price dropped to $29.00. Reasonable price for something I don't need and might not use. Picked it up Friday from the post office.It was stuffed into my post office box. I didn't know it would be so...tiny.That being said, when I eventually got around to setting the Dot up I was amazed that it connected so quickly. I was even more amazed at the variety of apps I could play with on this thing. Surprised to see the speaker wasn't as tinny sounding as reviews made it out to be. But then, I'm no audiophile so my opinion of sound quality is suspect. Got really bold and attempted connecting the Dot to my sound bar. Another effortless process and...WOW...what a vibrant sound. I also linked the Dot to my home security system. I can just as easily arm my system via it's readily accessible app or a mere slide on the system monitor, but it's cool to know I can ASK...gotta "ask"...Dot to secure my home.Switched Dot's name from "Alexa" to "Computer" so I wouldn't be continually calling a woman's name other my wife's. ( My wife, btw, immediately found the Dot to be annoying.)Spent a little while browsing SiriusXM and I heart radio stations before I was done my initial examination of the Dot. I'd seen enough so far to realize I really didn't need this device. It does nothing for me I couldn't easily do before purchase. It IS, however, a heck of a lot of fun.Well worth the purchase price.I want another one 'cause I'm geeky like that.
WOW. I have an original Amazon Echo and it works great but it's so tall. This little Echo dot is powered by micro USB and can fit anywhere. I am extremely impressed by this product at this price point. Everyone should get one of these and check it out. I use mine to control my Philips Hue lights and play free music through Amazon music, but there are so many other uses and I've barely scratched the surface of what this device can do.I don't think anyone is going to compete with this product at this price for a long time. It's well made and looks nice. The white color has a dark gray top and looks nice on the little table where I have it. It takes about 5 minutes to set everything up with the Alexa app. Excellent product.I also want to mention the built in speaker. It doesn't sound bad! If you just want to use it for background music, not too loud, it works great. But it also is able to send audio over Bluetooth to a bigger speaker, and it has a line out jack as well. So it could play music over a much larger stereo if desired.
These are just so darned handy! I have gotten so used to having Ms. Alexa around that I decided I should have one for traveling and to hook into my 2000-watt home stereo! Woohoo! For me, the Dot has replaced satellite radio, compact disc players and nearly my massive collection of mp3 files. Got it up and running quickly enough to be measured in seconds instead of minutes. Seriously... something like 200 seconds. Done. The Echo device series will have a memorable spot in history and pop culture, right up there with CD/DVD/VCRs, cell phones and GPS units.As for an actual review: The sound seems to be improved over the original Dot, though that could just be me. I thought it was too bad that they decided to lose the volume twist-top and use the "+ and -" buttons instead. That was a handy feature, but it's simple enough to say: "Alexa, set volume 4", "Turn it up/down" or to use the buttons. I also like that the new software recognizes that multiple Echo devices may exist in one area and it is able to determine which device is closest to the spoken Echo command. It's the stuff of science fiction! Ours are used mostly for weather, timers, music and news. While we haven't used the Echo devices to run our household, it's nice to know that the capabilities are there when we decide to upgrade to "connected" household items (HVAC, lights, alarm systems, door locks, garage doors, etc).
Having Alexa is actually more useful than I thought it would be.  I bought one just to try out and see what it's like.  Having the ability to just ask a question without picking up a phone or device is great.  If you have a prime account and have amazon music it's even better, I find myself more often then not just asking Alexa to play a station or a song and because it's linked to my prime account the music plays without me having to go through my phone.  I was very surprised at how decent the speaker on the echo dot is, I was expecting a crappy small speaker that was really going to rely on connecting to a Bluetooth speaker or physical connection.  The device works really well as a standalone speaker for a decent size room.  I wouldn't trade in your nice speakers over it but if you have 2/3 dots around the house it actually works fine by itself.  I never would have foreseen myself buying multiple but after having one I can see the use for having one on each floor of my house, as a music player, as a device for asking the weather, asking questions, setting alarms, adding things to a list, making purchases, using it to control Alexa enabled devices.  It's definitely worth it for the price.
This is really the most bang for the buck you can get with an Amazon-branded Alexa device right now.It puts the best microphones and the Alexa service into a really affordable and rather small device.The built-in speaker on the unit is weak at best, but that's OK - the geniuses that designed this hockey puck equipped it with the ability to connect to external speakers rather easily, and even if you don't use the headphone jack to connect it directly to your old-school floor shaker speaker/amp setup (which it does very well,) there are plenty of accessories available to turn this into a portable unit with battery and speakers to use it anywhere.Truly a marvelous device.  I own two of them, and if you're looking for something for the office that doesn't play very loud - the built-in speaker will be just fine.  If you want to do more with it - there are quite a few other options that will not disappoint, just like this little hockey puck won't.There's a reason that this is Amazon's best-selling Alexa device.
Wow. I find myself Calling out Alexa when I'm not even near it--or even home. This was a father's day total surprise gift from my son and wife. I had no idea it was even on anyone's radar...not even on mine after a brief consideration last Christmas. I didn't have high expectations, so it was easy to surpass them.  I have to say, it's blowing me away. It's even just a touch "scary." A bit life-like in a creepy AI sort of way...but still cool.  We have the dot, I don't even know what more the full blown model does, but it will surely take use months to explore just what this can do. I will caution that it's just one more "tech crutch" that we will so come to "rely" on that it's kinda sad. My ten year old said, "Good morning, Alexa" the other day without even acknowledging my presence. He also asks it the time, so there goes truly being able to tell time, at least on an analog clock. I love to wake up, stroll into the living room, and just say "Alexa, play 80s music" and adjust the volume with "Alexa, volume 6" without ever having to touch a switch, dial, or button. Wow. With the advent of DVRs some 15+ years ago, I remember I habitually reached for the remote in the movie theater as if I could rewind to catch that last line. Now, I find my self wanting to say, "Alexa, next song" every time Im' listening to music anywhere, and I'm not interested in the tune! Sad yet amazing and fun. We have barely touched its possibilities. "Alexa, Next review!"
Wife asked for this on Prime day.  She seems to think we need more bluetooth speakers.  I opted for this one instead of the full size echo because I figured that I could plug it into my stereo for better sound.  However, I also use the stereo receiver for home theater.  Once plugged into the receiver, it disables the built in speaker and I only get audio unless I either unplug the dot from the receiver or set the receiver input for the input the Echo is plugged into.  If we watch TV with it plugged in (not the echo input) we can't hear the response.I leave it unplugged and it works fine.  But we don't use it for music currently.As for skills, I have found few that are useful.  I have a harmony hub remote system and it works well turning on and off.  It turns on the TV, receiver, and streaming device.  But haven't figured out how to tell it to switch inputs or lower/increase volume or turn on the other activities.  While its nice to turn on the TV, receiver, and streaming device with my voice, I wish it could do more.I've tried to install other skills but so far have been underwhelmed by them.  Pizza hut skill allows me to order my previous order but need to call Pizza hut or use their app to change the order up.
I bought this Echo Dot as a birthday gift for my wife.  I have one that I got from my son as a Christmas gift and I love it.  Perhaps the one star is unfair because it's the Alexa app that stinks.  I cannot get into the setup part of the installation because the app won't let me complete the email address and/or the Amazon password.  I've uninstalled the app (and reinstalled it) several times but the problem keeps recurring.  I'm sure that if I ever get past this lousy app the Echo Dot will work just fine.
Works OK by itself, but has all kinds of issues with Bluetooth speakers.1) If your Bluetooth speaker goes to sleep after inactivity after a couple of hours, the echo will start playing music out of its internal speaker. This happened to me at 1 am and woke me up and freaked me out. This happens even if you have not been playing music recently and have told it to stop before going to bed. Really annoying and stupid, clearly a bug.2) If your Bluetooth speaker has more than one input and you change inputs to another device such as TV, the echo internal speaker also starts playing music. Sometimes I can be upstairs listening on my echo and my wife will switch Bluetooth downstairs and my upstairs music will stop and resume on the downstairs Echo internal speaker causing much consternation for all concerned.3) If you are connected to Bluetooth and someone calls or "drops in" from another Echo, the Dot disconnects itself from Bluetooth immediately. I think the aim is to switch to its internal speaker to avoid issues with echoing on the call, but the internal speaker either doesn't properly turn on, or it is too low to be heard. So drop in is useless on this thing with a Bluetooth speaker attached.4) 5GHz wireless keeps dropping out if located too close to the Bluetooth speaker, so had to switch to the standard network.
I have had my main Echo since the first days after the initial invitation to buy was sent out. I absolutely love Alexa and use her for tons of things daily. - she lives in the hallway between the living room and kitchen where we  spend the most time. I added the Dot a month ago to bring the Alexa functions into our master bedroom.The Dot is as easy to use as the big Echo and now that the two can be connected, we have music throughout the house at the same time. I also like the intercom skill so we can talk to each other across the house quickly. My one dislike is the tinny sounding small speaker n the Dot. I've grown so accustomed to the balanced, clean sound from the big Echo that the Dot sound quality was a let down with music. However, reading me the news, ordering Starbucks, reading my audio books, working as an alarm clock or intercom is smooth and works just fine. I especially like being able to control our tv with Alexa voice commands - we cut the cable cord and stream via Prime, Netflix and Hulu Live and Alexa has made searching for a specific show much more simple.
I had to wait until my daughter got here because I do not have the patience to get things connected. I'm also a great-grandma if that gives you a shot on my age ... a teen (or younger) knows more than I do about these things.But, Cyndi saved the Echo Dot for me! She's not a teenager. She came here to visit (1500 miles) and assumed I probably didn't get my Christmas present from her up and going which was absolutely correct so she did it for me. I'm far from being a techie. I don't have 2 screens that I can look at as I'm trying to remember all the things that I had just read, mainly because I didn't know what the heck or how the heck. BUT NOW IT IS DIFFERENT !!!Alexa and I are getting used to each other and I'm actually enjoying her and her choices and the bonus is that if I'm tired of her choices I can tell her to shut down. Love it! I'm in the process of asking more and more questions which is becoming fun. I have the Smart Wi-Fi Plug and she turns on my light when I come in or out the door. I need another one! And then I bet I'll be thinking about more... this could be dangerous... but why not? I jumped out of a airplane and only broke a fingernail. Yes, I had a parachute and back then you went solo on your firsts jump. So, why not this?I bake great cookies in case someone wants to tutor me. I live in Nebraska ... ((~.^))
I've stopped using these  mostly as SHE never hears, understands, wakes up --- pets getting upset hearing us shouting at Alexa .......Inconsistencies in playing digital radio stations --- you'll ask her for one you listen to every day and she can't find it.  Then ten minutes later she plays it.  Becomes non-responsive when music is playing (can't "hear" you over music).  Product that is not yet "finished".  But , when it works, multi-room music is a game changer. Cost-effective solution for hearing the same thing as you move through out the house without having to carry any device alone with you.  Often does not work smoothly with Kasa app to control plugs (as in "couch light doesn't support that" - request to turn it off). Can usually tell time and weather and is good at reminders and alarms (wish could set alarm for "EVERYWHERE" not just the speaker you addressed to set it, so if I wander into another room, I'd still hear it).  Sort of a mixed bag in the second generation.
I am a techie that has been troubled in getting on board with the smart watches and voice everything. I grabbed a Dot (too cheap for the Echo). I am floored at the complexity yet usability of this thing. And was totally shocked on how decent it sounded. No it is not going to rattle the windows but I really expected it to be unusable for background music. It really has a decent sound so will not be adding speakers to it. I am just learning how to connect to a few gadgets and the vocabulary will take a little more work. But I really am impressed. Out of the many gadgets I have purchased - this one is staying put! Now I am on the hunt for more gadgets to interface with it!
Thanks for watching and reading my review of the Amazon Echo.  In fact, it's actually a review of just a few of the many possibilities of home automation.  I got started with home automation back in October, 2017 when I purchased a Nest Smart Thermostat.  I followed up by purchasing an Amazon Echo and Harmony Hub for my Home Theater/AV Equipment.  From there I started purchasing some of the "Smart Outlets" to use with my regular lights, and for the holiday season, my Christmas lights.As shown in the video, I am now able to control ALL my Christmas lighting with one command, as well as control the temperature in the house and what I want to watch or listen to on the TV or stereo.  I know I've only scratched the surface of all the capabilities that are afforded by the Echo.  Once you purchase an Echo I encourage you to keep an eye on the Amazon "Skills" because that is where you will find even more useful capabilities.  It takes a bit of tweaking on what you "name" your "activities" or "devices" but once you get that setup, Alexa does a very good job of completing your request on the first try.As noted in the video, I have the following setup:Amazon Echo (2nd Generation) and Echo Dot (2nd Generation)Nest Thermostat (3rd Generation)Logitech Harmony Hub (controls TV, Apple TV, Receiver, etc)TP-Link Bluetooth Receiver (connected to my Yamaha Receiver audio input)OTHWAY Smart OutletDekinmax Smart OutletI hope you found the video and review helpful.
I added a Dot to my Echo, even though I was not sure how the two would work together in my home. I was also dreading the Dot set-up, as the Echo had been a difficult wifi connection for me. I need not have worried on either count. The set-up was quick and simple, as the Alexa app had stored all of the wifi data and did the linking automatically, quick test of the two devices proved that they work together seamlessly. I am glad that I added the Dot and look forward to enjoying the added flexibility of using Alexa in two different parts of the house. Also, I am very pleased with the Dot speakers - no externals are needed.
I'm kind of an old-timer and at first I didn't think I needed an Echo Dot.  Now that I have one, I don't know how I lived without it. And I feel this way in spite of having a smart phone with a a similar feature.  I mean this just sits on my living room table and waits quietly and unobtrusively until I need it.  Then Alexa jumps into action to meet my request.  I kind of feel like the Captain of the Starship Enterprise!  No doubt that my being a heavy Amazon shopper, Kindle book reader, and Prime member makes the experience better.  What really surprised me is how clear the speaker is and how smooth the voice recognition is.  Of course, Amazon makes no claims that the Dot's little speaker is hi-fidelity, but it is much, much better than I expected and if I want to play a quick song or listen to the radio in a room where I have no other speaker, it's not bad at all. I won't go into all the many features, but because I have a second gen FireTV Stick, it even controls my FireTV, including the all inportant pause and play features.  In closing, this is a well implemented product that works!
I have never asked my Echo Dot to switch on my lights or order me pizza. I can do those things myself. I bought it as an internet radio. I wanted it to replace an Ocean Digital unit that worked, but was awkward to use and kept losing the WiFi signal. I also hoped the Echo would be able to stream Spotify, which the internet radio couldnt. I chose the Dot rather than the big Echo because it seemed pointless spending $179 instead of $49 just to get better sound quality, when I could easily plug in a pair of speakers.At first, the Echo Dot would only send sound to one speaker, so it was retired to a bedroom draw. But when I tried it again a few months later it worked properly (an Alexa update?). And it works really well. Besides the local New York stations, which it gets through iHeart, it has no difficulty streaming domestic stations from the UK, in that case through TuneIn. It even managed to find an obscure community-run station in my home town in England.There is the odd glitch. You need to tell Alexa which station you want very clearly. Also, public radio stations sometimes have a message before the station itself plays, and occasionally those messages can loop, and stop the livestream from loading. And I was unable at first to get BBC World Service, until I remembered that Alexa is only a computer program and needs to be told World Service is a radio station (you ask for World Service Radio). Overall, though, the Echo Dot makes a great little Internet radio. It also has an effective sleep timer, and can wake you up (though not yet with a radio station  but I suspect that will come).The Echo Dot can also stream Spotify, important for me because I have a premium account and am a heavy user. But here Alexa is less effective; you have to ask very clearly for what you want. Also, asking for (say) Beethovens Fifth Symphony will only get you the first movement   if you want the whole thing, you must ask clearly for the album by its full name, or group the tracks under a playlist and ask for that. (Thats often the easiest way, as you can give the playlist a clear, simple name that Alexa can understand.) Just occasionally there are tracks Alexa cant find at all; ask her for Bob Dylans Blind Willie McTell and she will give you one of those two musicians, not the song. I think Amazon has some work to do here. But Spotify does function, and when you do get what you want, the sound quality is excellent. In fact its not bad even without external speakers  I sometimes use the Dot ion its own n the kitchen or bathroom, and its more than good enough for a small room.I have two reservations. First, Id like it to be easier to manage my Echo Dot from a proper keyboard; you can, but Amazon dont seem to like it, preferring you to use an Apple or Android app. But not everyone likes fiddling around on small screens. Second, and more important, if you use an Echo youre giving Alexa a lot of information about you.  For example, if she knows which radio stations you listen to, she may be able to target you for advertising. Or figure out your politics, and target you for fundraising.  So far as I know Amazon dont use my Alexa data for this, and I would prefer them not to.Even so, I think the Echo Dot is great value. It does work with Spotify, albeit not perfectly; and as an internet radio its first-class, much better value than a dedicated unit, which can cost $120 or more.  And if you use it to work your lights or order your pizza as well, youll be getting an awful lot for $49.
I bought these specifically for the Multi-Room audio feature, only to find out it doesn't work with Bluetooth. You can only use Multi-Room audio if you have your speaker systems hard wired through the Dots rear jack. This is a pain because unless I am playing music, I don't keep the speakers on, but if you have a cable plugged into the Dot, there's no way to make it use its internal speaker.So there's two limitations that I'm really surprised Amazon missed:1) You cannot toggle between wired/internal speaker without physically unplugging the audio cable2) You can toggle between internal and Bluetooth speakers, but Multi-Room audio will not work
The Achilles Heal of Amazon Echo/Alexa devices reared it's ugly head recently as the Amazon Systems that ALL functions of these device depend on became sluggish or completely unresponsive.  A notice (see image) on the first page of My Alex App has a statement saying as much.  That translates into me yelling at my Echo with nothing but silence and blinking lights or totally misunderstanding simple commands and at time it starts playing some random tune it want's me to purchase..it's become annoyingly stupid and virtually useless.  The BIG problem for me is you can search Google and see this is a problem that has occurred periodically for Amazon Echo/Alexa service, even back into 2016.  I love my Echo Dots (4 of them) BUT over the last couple weeks they are more work and frustration to use than they are helpful. I wonder if Amazon may have bitten off more than it can chew OR possibly more than ANY current systems can efficiently support.
Works as advertised, received my second dot today.  First one is in the living room and the second one is in my bedroom.Setup was a breeze through the app. Sound was great, but I did try a Bluetooth headset, and she paired with it.  All one has to do is say Alexa volume 1 for low or five for medium volume, etc.I also paired to a wireless speaker, the jam touch. Again all volume is just speak to Alexa.  Also if you want great sound connect it to your sound system.When the alarm goes off it will definitely get you out of bed.I am considering another one for the kitchen. Also the light bulbs, I keep losing the remote for my lamps or it's always away from where your sitting.Getting my set up for smart devices is intriguing and exciting at the same time.  The future is now!!  Don't delay in buying this item, you can't go wrong for the price.You do have to set up the first time with your wi-fi so you have to remember your router name and password for the initial setup. Also, download the Alexa app and setup is a breeze, just follow the on screen instructions.
Alexa is a game changer.  First came Siri, more a gimmick and "occasional, sometimes" tool than anything else.  Google's assistant, Cortana... same thing. Then came Alexa - who combined the power and user friendliness of Siri (noting that you have to be very precise with some commands) with access to a huge number of verbal-command driven apps, and existing content via Amazon Prime.What does this mean vis-a-vis the echo dot.  If you have Prime, you access to a ton of musical content via Amazon Music.  If you have toddlers or young children, the little kids channel, the ability to play songs by "Barney" and "Elmo," the lullaby channel, and the background / white noise capabilities make the echo dot a must have.  You don't need the better speaker for those purposes.But what's even more exciting is how Amazon is building on Alexa.  Add Amazon music to your phone and you have something that is almost as good as an echo dot for the above purposes, carried with you / in the car.  The Echo View has great potential - but maybe even more if Amazon creates a (pay-for) Echo View app for IOS and Android so folks can use existing tablets with the same functionality.Great job, Amazon engineers. Alexa may be nearly "iphone 1" big.
I picked up the Dot during the 12 days of Christmas promotion, and just love it! I still have a lot to learn about all I can do with it, but set-up was very easy, and functionally, I don't know how it could get any better. I like the news briefing, and the fact that you can choose your own news source.  The sound is amazing, and I don't have it connected to speakers.With our large family here on Christmas eve, we could hear Christmas music playing over the din of voices...many kids included.I don't bother checking the weather on my smartphone anymore...Alexa gives me current temperature plus the days forecast instantly.It is an amazing device I didn't know I needed or wanted, and when I saw the promotion price, I decided to try it out... what a great deal!One of my kids got me the remote for Christmas, and although I haven't used it yet, I am expecting it be a valuable addition to the Dot.Thanks again Amazon, you rock!!
This was an impulse buy on my part, and my husband's eye roll confirmed that, once again, I'd bought another frivolous  toy. Well, last night I purchased a second Dot for my spouses's upstairs office, at his request! (Insert wifely fist pump here!)  The dot (you'll find yourself referring to her as a "she") is a great assistant: "Alexa" creates shopping lists, will give you on-time reminders, schedules appointments (which automatically show up on your Google calendar), plays music, gives weather forecasts, answers trivia questions,and syncs with your smart phone. The ONLY negative is the set-up for the more advanced functions, which is not all that streamlined or intuitive. It took  longer than I thought it should, and requires patience. I also think that if you add an item to your shopping list or calendar, you should be able to remove it by asking "Alexa" to delete, but she tells you that you have to access the Alexa app on your phone, tablet, etc. and delete there. The process should be easier than that, in my opinion. But, all-in-all, if you have $45 to spare, the Echo Dot makes a great personal assistant!
We've had an echo for a long  time. We were one of the first in the beta deal and got it for a very cheap price. We use it much more than I thought we ever would. My wife loves it for music, math equations, food measurement conversions, weather, and news. We also have it controlling our lights and our ecobee thermostat. We just got the echo dot and I must admit I think I like it even more. I bluetooth-ed it to my Bose mini soundlink and it sounds fantastic. Other than that, it performs equally as good as our full sized echo but it's much smaller and way cheaper. We got it for the black friday price of $39.99 which to me is a steal for all it can do. The Googe Home seemed interesting but for Less than $50, and the ability to hook up to stereo or bluetooth speakers, the dot just seems the better choice. If you can still get it on sale, I think it's an excellent deal and has been very helpful and entertaining for our family. It doesn't do everything but what it does do, it does well for a cheap price.
I love it
I got this for my daughter for Christmas and wanted to wait awhile before writing a review. Here it is over a month later and we still love it. The whole family likes to use it. We play music, ask questions, leave each other messages, order products and set alarms. We even play pranks on each other like setting it to play horrible music at a specific time so right in the middle of dinner it starts playing punk rock or smooth jazz (depending on who set it). It all sounds lame and yet we laugh like crazy and keep doing it. I also got one of the plugs which we use for a light. This is great for when the kids get up in the middle of the night. They can call from their bedrooms to turn on the light and it has kept them from waking me every time someone needs a drink or to go to the bathroom (because they can't get out of bed in a dark room and risk monsters attacking their feet)
Ahhh, my first SMART HOME endeavor. I'm a tech nut, and I have Bose Soundtouch throughout the whole house. The ONLY reason I bought this was because Bose finally added the integration of Alexa Skills. Alexa does what she's told. My pet peeve is the wording and the capabilities of the commands in which I bought it for. Not sure if I should be mad at Bose or Amazon, but maybe they need to collaborate more. It's awkward to say, ALEXA, ASK BOSE TO PLAY PRESET 1 IN THE LIVING ROOM. I was hoping for, Alexa, play Shinedown Radio (Spotify) in the living room and kitchen. BUT you really only have the option of saying (PRESET #) followed by room name or ALL SPEAKERS. Which defeats the purpose of my intended use, because I still have to get my phone out and group the speakers that I want to play. All in all, it's very cool. But hopefully the skill gets updated to talk less robotic. Would also be cool to resume the last group -- ie constantly link kitchen to living room unless told otherwise through the soundtouch app. It would also be great if Amazon allowed you to change your default WAY to play music, not just the default service. Right now, if I say ALEXA play shinedown radio, it plays through the echo dots speaker. Some would say just connect it to Bluetooth but then the quality sucks. Overall it was well worth $30, and I look forward to updates from both companies to better the experience.
We ordered this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas this past year.  We already have the Echo and love it.  She loves listening to Pandora and other music on the dot and we just figured out a really awesome feature that it has.  You can call and send messages from the Echo to the Echo dot and vise vera.  So, when she's upstairs in her room, I don't need to yell up to her when I need her to come down....I just call the dot.  Pretty awesome.  One misconception that we came across when we ordered it was that you needed a speaker to connect to the dot.  This is not the case.  We ordered a bluetooth speaker and she never used it.  The dot has a built in speaker and quality isn't bad especially for a small space like her bedroom.  Also, you don't need the regular Echo for the Dot to work.  Im not sure what the difference is between the two beside the size, but it works perfect for her. Also, set up is pretty easy.  You just download the app and connect it to wi-fi and follow the instructions from there.  Very self explanatory.  This is an awesome gift if you are looking for something for that person that has everything.
I originally wasn't interested in this type of device since I am always on a computer and I have a IPhone. So why do I need another virtual assistant when I have 2 (Cortana on computer and siri on iPhone). But my parents had gotten this recently and showed me how better it is. It truly is. As Cortana and Siri will mostly give you links to what you need Alexa will obviously tell you what you want to know. I also thing the device is the perfect size as it can be placed pretty much anywhere no matter how big or small the space.The price is great for such a device. I only paid $29.99 (though I think it was on sale).The only downer is its a little complicated to set up. Download an app, and many steps. I mean it is easy but so much work involved.Pros:-Tells you what you want to know-Perfect size-PriceCons:-many steps to set up
One skill Dot, or for that matter, Alexia, does NOT have is the ability to understand plain ordinary ENGLICH!!!  I ask this idiot to play my Contemporary Jazz station from Pandora and she comes back proudly saying, "Playing your 80's hits radio station"... WITHOUT EXCEPTION!!!  When I demand Alexa stop playing, she/he/it ignores me!!  A lot of time she/he/it says, "sorry, having problems understanding now.  She/he/it just has a problem with following requests  Never again will I buy any amazon voice recognition article!!!  Another problem which has cropped up recently are DROPOUTS while playing music from Pandora.  The problem is not with Pandora or my router since the only device which has this problem is the Alexa.  My tablet works fine on Pandora, same for my iPhones.  Methinks Amazon needs to consult with the Chinese counterparts that build this device.... and probably engineered it.... about fixing this problem.
I don't write many reviews mostly because I don't have too much time yet I find myself reading other people reviews every time I am going to purchase something so it is my goals from now on to start writing reviews more often.After researching and reviewing similar products I decided to buy the Echo Dot and give it try. I fell in love immediately and went to buy another one right away! A few of the things that I like the most is the notifications I get when my Amazon packages are on the way and when I receive them. I like that you have the ability to create different lists and Alexa can add the items for you to each individual list when you tell her to, so far I have a Grocery List, Traveling Items list, and the Menu for the Week list, etc. I have Amazon Prime so I love the variety of music I can listen to for free. I also have 4 smart plugs and a bluetooth speaker. They were easy to set up with the Alexa app. Now Alexa can turn my tv and my lights on when I want to, yes! Of course is always good to check on the weather and news briefs every time I get a chance.I think the Echo Dot is the perfect size and it has a good speaker. Really easy to set up! If you are still thinking about getting one or two, today is the day! Do it! :)
This little echo is a great entry point to Alexa!  If you are looking for a way to get started with Alexa and a smart home, this is a good start at a reasonable price.  Currently own two of these for different parts of our house and have had a lot of use so far out of them.  I've used the bluetooth connection to tie into a bluetooth speaker for one room and the audio cable port to hook into our stereo system for a separate room.  The audio on the dot is fine for talking with Alexa and getting Alexa info.  If you want to listen to a quick tune, it's fine as well but you will really want to tie this to a nice speaker system if you want great music.  Really worth the money to spread Alexa to various rooms around the house and extend other speaker systems with Alexa capabilities.  Would definitely recommend if you want to dip your toe into the smart home world but don't want to take an expensive plunge just yet.
My Amazon Echo was purchased in February of 2014. From that time, Alexa and I have worked together well. We have performed all the skills, and Alexa is my go to source. Recently my two radios, one in the bathroom, and one in the kitchen, have become old and have retired. I purchased an Echo Dot to replace the radio in the bathroom, and it is performing so well, I need another for the kitchen.Since, I had an Echo, the set up for the Echo Dot was very familiar. I plugged it in, and then followed directions. Set up to Wifi was very easy and went smoothly. In no time at all, Echo and I were pals. I love to listen to NPR while I shower in the morning, and now it is a breeze. If the electricity goes out, I do not need to reprogram my radio, EchoDot just picks up from where we left off.  Echo Dot does not have the Omni audio that my original Echo has, but I can fix that with a Bluetooth. I also can stream music via Amazon, and almost any song or artist is available.I am enameled with the Amazon Echo and the Echo Dot, far and above any other device I have. My only problem is that I need another one. How many Echo Dots can one household support?Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-12-17
Unfortunately I have found that the functionality of Alexa does not live up to the idea of Alexa. It appears to genuinely understand the words that are coming out of my mouth but doesn't  seem to have a clue what to do about it. Also if you live outside the US, Canada or UK you may be out of luck for simple tasks like look ups for weather in your immediate area and dialing from your contact list.As a test we asked Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google the same set of questions and everyone but Alexa provided consistent, legitimate answers. Alexa would either answer "I'm afraid I don't have an answer for that." or "I would rather not answer that." Both answers are things you don't really want to hear from your personal assistant... human or otherwise.I have no doubt this product will get better but right now it appears to have a lot of learning to do and unfortunately it's at the consumers expense.
Although the gadget quit working/responding, I received absolutely EXCELLENT customer service and support via Amazon, a woman in Jamaica and Kevin, an Echo Tech in WA state.Amazon completely supports their products and provides the Nordstrom, Cadillac of customer service!I cannot fully express the excellent level of support and service that Amazon provides.The moment that I posted my dismay with this product, Amazon reached out to me to ensure that I was 100% satisfied. I am amazed!I first spoke to a customer service representative in Jamaica who was kind, polite, knowledgeable and patient. When that person was not able to completely satisfy me, they sent me to another person, Kevin, an Echo Tech, who provided the highest level of customer service and support possible. He made certain that the issue was resolved to the complete satisfaction of the customer.This kind of customer service and support is unheard of in this day and age.THANK YOU for you help and expertise!I have been looking at a new phone on Amazon. Now that I know that Amazon completely stands behind its customers and their products, I will not hesitate to make an Amazon supported purchase.I know that if Amazon is offering a product, they will stand behind it 100%!Previous note, issue has been corrected:Fun little gadget while it lasted. I may purchase again if I can find one at a very good price. I am thankful that I did not pay the full price for this or I would be even more unhappy.Worked for approximately a year, then stopped working, no sound.Went through all trouble shooting.
Have to admit, i'm quite impressed with its ability to understand speech.  My accent usually does not work well with many voice recognition systems.  Good quality, Good connectivity, and Very easy to do the initial set-up.The range of interface to smart-home devices and IOT devices is good, but not great.  I have many Internet connected devices at home that it does not (yet??) detect or work with.  Hopefully time will improve that as Amazon and device manufacturers build the required API interfaces.Value was good at 29.99 over the Christmas sales, but i don't think it is worth its usual listed price of 49.99.I dropped 1 star as the one big thing it realllllly needs... a built in battery.  I use it with an external battery pack so i can move it around rooms, but its a bit of a pain doing that.  I would pay the 50 price if it had a built in battery.
I really liked this and hate that I have to change my review. I was able to upload most of my iTunes music to the music app and play it via the Dot. Now it seems you can no longer upload from a PC/MAC and that is just all kinds of wrong. I bought this to play my music, was told it would play the itunes songs and after I've had it a few months they want to change the rules. I'll be buying another product from another company that will let me play my songs. I've been a loyal Amazon customer for years and this just is not right. Amazon it seems is going after more money instead of caring what their customers what or need.
I picked up one of the first Echos when they first debuted. I think I had to get on a waiting list. Once we received it Alexa became a part of the family. It's funny how useful she can be.Always thought it would be a good thing for my Mom. So when a Xmas deal popped up, I jumped. Set up was just as easy as the Echo.But what was really impressive was the microphones. I was trying to find a place where it could pick up my Mom's soft voice in the kitchen and living room. Turns out I needn't had worried. This thing picked up my voice way down the hallway.I will say the speaker isn't anywhere near the quality of the Echo. So if you want music, it might be wise to pick up a speaker to attach.Overall, though, a great product that my Mom (probably a technophobe) is finding new things to do with every day.
I received this little device today and took a few attempts (brief attempts) to get it operational.  It's not the audio quality of a bose speaker but it is nice to have in the bathroom, for example, NOT the shower or bath but away from water (specifically as you have to have it plugged in to a wall outlet).  It would be nice to have one in the kitchen as well.  So far I enjoy asking my Echo to find a station on my Pandora account for music.  I also enjoy having it add items to my grocery list.  I also enjoy asking it to set a timer for me.  I don't know how many different skills I will attempt to use.  So far I can see why individuals with visual impairment would enjoy this feature.  Once it is set up, it's basically handsfree.  I also enjoy asking the current weather, future weather and for news updates.  I still wish for a visible clock.  Then again, I'm "old school".  I could just ask for the time but I bet I'd ask many many times in the morning, whilst readying for work.  I think this is, once set up, is ideal for those not terrified of technology and also for those with visual impairments.  I haven't ordered pizza yet.
This little Gadget is awesome. I gave it 5 stars because it does what it says and it works very well. Now it was very easy to hook up handworks just fine. Now I know this is on you product and the skills are limited and they're making new skills for it. It can insult you, it can make you laugh, which it has plenty of times. My whole family uses it whenever they passed by they asked for a joke they are funny. The your mama jokes are funny too. This would be even better if it has skills for information it is limited to what it can do what is a very fun Gadget to play . I've used it to play music, I've also used it to ask the time to set reminders it's capable of doing lots of things looking forward to new skills there are so many things that I can do. If you get one which I recommend play with the app to get the skills you want and use it. There is no battery so you can't move it around the house unless you unplug it or buy a battery pack that I believe they sell for it to move it around the house. You cannot take it with you at least outside of your Wi-Fi range. Would be cool if you can take this wherever you go and use it if you can I haven't figured that out yet. yet that will be super cool it comes with its own plug for powering it up and to connect to a separate speaker if you want. As for the way it sounds you can control the volume on the echo Dot and you can also connected to a Bluetooth speaker you can also connect your cell phone to it or tablet Android volume off of the echo Dot. I like the volume that it has I don't use a Bluetooth speaker I don't think you need it unless you want it louder. I DJ so I can connect it to my system and get more volume butt no need for it it's loud enough for me. It's a little bigger than a hockey puck I have it in white. It comes in different colors they have a couple of accessories you can buy for it. This by far is the coolest Gadget I've gotten for myself. I definitely recommend this for everyone that has Wi-Fi. If you get one play with it and enjoy lots of fun.
I purchased the Amazon Echo what it first came out and I liked it so much that I bought a Dot for my bathroom.  The Dot's speaker isn't very good, so please be prepared to also purchase a speaker  (or pair a speaker you already have).The technology is great and fun! You can do a ton of things without adding skills, but I think the majority of the perks come with the IFTTT compatibility.  It takes a second to wrap your mind around the concept (I'm so not a techie), but after I got the hang of it - it took this device to a new level! I set up logic that texts me when it's about to rain in my area!I Would have given this 4 stars, but I bought this on Prime Day and for $35, it's well worth it!I did buy one at full price and rated it 4 starts bc I had to buy a Bluetooth compatible speaker to get decent sound outta this device and that team me another $100.I also wish the device held a charge and didn't have to be plugged in to work.  I saw a battery you can buy, but it costs just as much as I paid for the device. Ughhhhh.The device did travel well.  I bought a carrying case and it was so easy to set up in my hotel room.
We're having so much fun with our Echo Dot! Everyday we add at least 25 to 50 or more new skills to Alexa (as our time allows). I'm now doing a daily breathing meditation every day with her and every morning she greets me cheerily and at night she gives me some sage advice about the end of the day. The other day she called our cat from our bedroom to our living room by meowing! It was so, so funny because OUR cat couldn't figure out where the other cat was! We're going to save so much money not having to call each other's phones any longer when we lose them in the house because now Alexa will find them for us for free! They can even be on silent and they will still ring! I won't miss my appointments any longer just because I forget to be close to my phone when it beeps once; I can hear Alexa's reminder no matter where I am in the house. I also can't wait until we're finished setting up our smart home for Alexa to control in the next few weeks! The cost for the Dot was so very reasonable too; everyone should get one.
I got this thinking it would be good to have in the kitchen while I cook so I could listen to the radio and podcasts not get my wet/dirty hands on it, but I found it almost impossible to get it to play any radio station that I wanted to listen to even though these stations are available on TuneIn radio. It isn't very versatile in figuring out what you're trying to say. Very frustrating. It can only play the latest  episode of any podcast and cannot go to the archive to play older episodes. I also found out that I can't use it for making calls without having my telephone registered to it but, my telephone has an older version of android which doesn't work with Alexa. I would have to buy a new telephone to use this feature. All in all I would say that Alexa is not quite ready for prime time yet. It only can use a few apps and it doesn't do that very well. An example is that you can listen to Spotify ONLY if you have a premium account $$$. I think that Amazon should polish this quite a bit more before selling it to the public. It's basically a very expensive egg timer for me. I plan to return it.
I have 2 Echo Dots and a Echo.  The echo makes a great music device, the echo dot is a nice extension for my smart home and is still great for stuff like getting my news in the morning.  Alone I would say an echo is a great device, with several smart home devices it's even better.  With 3 echos around my house sometimes two will pick up the wake word at the same time.  This has caused issues and I would rather not change the wake word as it could confuse others in the house.  With that said it's normally minor and not a big deal.How much my echo dots do could be best summarized with my normal day:Wake up in the morning/afternoon because of my work schedule I keep my room quite devoid of sunlight.  "Alexa turn on bedroom" Without getting to bed or having an annoying bedside light my room's light turns on thanks to a hue bridge/light bulb and Alexa being able to control hue lights.  "Alexa what's the news" and now I get my customizable flash briefing while I'm getting out of bed.  Walk out of the room saying "Alexa turn off bedroom" no need for a poorly positioned light switch to flick off.While I'm making food "Alexa, play my main playlist" and I can listen to music without having to worry about turning on a device.  As the food gets done "Alexa, turn on TV" and "Alexa, stop" music turns off and my harmony hub turns on my TV.  By the time I get there it's ready for me to use and I can play TV.  Getting ready for work while watching TV, ready to leave don't want to grab the remote "Alexa, turn off TV" done.  Get home it's all dark "Alexa, turn on living room".There are a lot of badly positioned light switches in the house, needing less remotes and in some cases Harmony/Alexa being able to do things quicker is always a good thing.  I have 3 different areas in my room where I might switch and carrying at any time 2-3 remotes around is a pain.  Being able to play music on voice command is great along with being able to turn it off.  Alexa can also be used remotely with my fire tablet and my Fire TV also supports Alexa.  Alexa can also tell jokes and do other things that can also make it a great thing for friends to try to do.  I can even ask Alexa for the movie list of my local theater and ask her about a given movie for more information.  All without having to get up and check my computer or my phone/tablet.It's not all great though, She makes mistakes, she can't hear to well over loud music including her own and multiple people talking in the background causes mistakes to happen.  Once in a while she'll even respond to the TV randomly even when the TV doesn't say Alexa.  The most annoying thing about echo is that without a Wifi connection it can do almost nothing.
I am a newbie in home automation so Alexa is uncharted territory for me. I started out with the Echo (2nd gen), Hue Bulbs and SmartThings but found out I needed a little more boost in other rooms. Setting up the Dot was an absolute breeze after having setup the Echo first, pretty much plugged it in an there it was. Of course, make sure everything is on the same network. I am able to control several things so far such as my lights in another room, my entertainment stuff, play music in one or all rooms, set alarms and more. I am in the process of still getting things situated the way I want but as for the Dot, it has taken a lot of frustration out of setup. My wife was somewhat skeptical of getting all of this done (she is very techno-challenged) but when she came home with her hands full and simply said to turn on the lights, she was sold. I would recommend this to anyone getting started with home automation.
Fact that I posted a review and they responded was awesome. Great customer service always wins. They listen to feed back. Still not best device but if they are always improving the software then that's awesome. As long as I don't have to buy new hardware for every new update like Mac's.Also other improvements I would like is local deliveries can tag a area on Alexa. Either Alexa picks up your location or you enter it. So I can say alexa what delivers. Then alexa can name off a few types of food. Pizza, Chinese, sandwhichs/subs, or whatever. Then you say order chinese and it can list what Chinese restaurants order near you. Either call them for you or you voice order online through the app. It should automatically apply it to you credit card/debit  hooked to Amazon.Also be nice if they could work with Google so their search results could be combined.Maybe not limit everything to Amazon. Like add nook for other users. I use kindle but when it's a monopoly I feel rebellion.
I like my Echo Dot. But I like my Google Home better and it all comes down to vocabulary.My primary uses of the Echo are:1. playback streaming audio (via a HyperGear speaker)2. smart home control3. Play the occasional game (e.g. Jeopardy)4. Set reminders or timersEcho is pretty good at recognizing my commands, except that its vocabulary is not as natural as that of Google:ECHO vs GOOGLE HOME MINI : Smart Home VocabularyMy voice queries are in single quotes, the answer from the device are in double quotes. To be fair, I actually used the Google assistant on my phone rather than the Mini, because the mini is in another room at the moment, however the vocabulary for the device and phone app is the same. 'OK, Google, which of my lights are on?' and it told me"The Lamp is on, the kitchen, living room, office and the Christmas Lights Outdoors are off"Alexa just has no clue how to answer that or any similar questions here are several attempts:'Alexa, which of my lights are on?' (badump - failure tone),'Alexa, what lights are turned on?' -> "A few things share that name which one did you want?"; 'Office' -> "Office doesn't support that" or 'All of them' -> "Sorry I didn't find All";'Alexa: is my office light on?' -> Office doesn't support that".  'Alexa: Is lamp on now?' -> OK (turns lamp on)NOTE: The Kitchen, Living Room and Office lights are LIFX lights, the Lamp is a Eufy bulb, and the Christmas Lights Outdoor is a Martin Jerry smart plug.REMINDER VocabularyMost other advertised uses for Alexa I find cumbersome. For example to use the reminder feature of Alexa/Echo, if you set more than one reminder 'Alexa, cancel my reminders' responds with "You have two active reminders, visit the Alexa App to cancel one of them.". You CAN do something like this:'Alexa, what are my reminders?` (it answers with the lists and times), then 'Alexa, cancel my 12:45 reminder'. Canceling the reminder that way confirms it has canceled the reminder, but it is still listed in the Alexa App as a card with no indication that it was canceled.The problem with the Alexa App, is that almost everything you say shows up as a card. I may have told or asked Alexa to play songs a dozen times, and I have to scroll through a lot of cards... or fumble through the "Home -> Hamburger icon -> Reminders and Alarms -> Reminders" after the app finishes loading all the recent activity. And then your option is to "Mark completed" not "Delete"Google isn't much better here. In fact, it's worse. It also runs you through the app to accomplish the task.GAMESAlexa/Echo wins here. Much more to play interactively, though to be honest most of it gets old quickly.SELECTING and PLAYING Music'Alexa, play Tran Siberian Orchestra Christmas Music' sort of worked because I usually listen to the I Heart Radio and it created the channel. But it wasn't Christmas Music that it selected. 'Alexa, play prime music Tran Siberian Orchestra Christmas Music'  "... isn't included in Amazon Prime..."GENERIC QuestionsI was astonished the first time I asked Google 'What times does southwest flight 1385 arrive in San Francisco' and it rattled off the full details including when it left, that it was ahead of time and the gate and time of arrival. If you ask the question properly, Alexa does quite a decent job as well, including providing an important bit of information that Google does not: which TERMINAL the flight arrives at (Google names the gate). The main difference between the two platforms, however, is you can ask Google the same question in your car as you can at home while the Alexa App doesn't seem to have any kind of voice interface. To be fair, I'm using and Android phone which Google has very strong ties to.Try this question:"Alexa, what times does southwest flight 1385 arrive"  or "Alexa, what is the status of southwest flight 1385"You can even mix things around a little bit but not this much: "Alexa, what is the status of flight 1385 southwest". And this is a bad fail: "Alexa, what is the status of flight 1385 of southwest airlines" 'I don't have any information for Southwest Airlines flight 1385'Asking about a flight that has multiple segments (e.g. SWA 1147 from Houston -> Denver -> LAS -> SFO) may tell you the flight has already landed even when you give it a strong hint that you only want know about one segment:|"Alexa, what time does southwest flight 1147 arrive in San Francisco?" '... Landed in Houston'"OK, Google, what time does southwest flight 1147 arrive in San Francisco?" '... from Los Angeles departs in 6 hours, 12 minutes.' That is, it's only telling me about the last segment, but doesn't tell me the SCHEDULED arrival time.PRIME MEMBERSHIPThere are definitely some advantages - you get more questions in Jeopardy, a healthy selection of music (though not what I tried above), and of course movies.CONCLUSIONS:Google wins on using natural vocabulary - in most cases. Amazon has more features at the moment... so it's a toss up.  Although I notice you don't seem to be able to order Google Home Mini on Amazon...
I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say "alexa" or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music.
Oh my. How easy it was to start using it. It is a true plug-and-play.  When Amazon announced the new Echo Dot, I ordered it right away. (In fact, I ordered two, and holding one as a holiday gift to my son.) My son thought it was going to be just another gadget, but he uses mine just about everyday, and I can see that he is going to want his own to use in his room. The accessibility to music is great. Lots of "skills" already built in, and I'm looking forward to discovering more skills as they become available. Right now we mainly use it for playing music, but it's also handy to just be able to ask what time it is in any foreign country, as I often communicate with overseas for work and with family.  We hooked our Dot up to a good set of Bose speakers, but even without the external speakers, it has a pretty good speaker if you are hearing it in a small room. The voice recognition is amazingly accurate. I am impressed. I wasn't at all interested in the earlier version of Echo, but with this tiny size of Dot, I was sold! I LOVE it.
A fabulous little device that has become a part of our every day lives.  The Echo Dot starts as a cool novelty item that my daughter enjoys playing games, getting facts, jokes and stories from.  It has turned into much more, the ability to have shared lists for the different user accounts is the largest daily benefit my wife and I see.  We are able to better manage to do lists and shopping lists on the go being able to each add and complete items on the lists simplifying life.  The other massive benefit, it's the easy control system for all the home automation pieces I've added within my home.  Being able to verbally control the lighting, temperature and electrical sockets from a single point instead of individual phone apps has been a extremely convenient function.  I have my Echo Dots interfacing with my Nest, Phillips Hue and WEMO product seamlessly.I have been extremely happy with the Echo Dots and now have 3 in my home, I highly recommend owning one.
I love my Alexia dot.  I love the Alexia period.  It takes a moment for her and me to understand each other on occasion, and overall, it's fantastic.  I love that she can give me 'verbal' confirmations that what I ask is done.  Also, some of my favorite commands: "add (whatever)" to my grocery list (no writing it down, leaving the list at home, etc., makes shopping so simple), wake-up alarms, call and other reminders (sometimes the phone dies and miss things), timers, and music.  It feels easier to manage my life.  My only downside and the reason for the lack of 5 stars, is sound quality is great and not like the big Eco with the great speakers. I listen to ocean sounds courtesy of Alexa at night to fall asleep to it even though it's muffled sounding after listening to the Echo.  I'm going to look into other Echo tools, maybe for my car, and home for sure.
