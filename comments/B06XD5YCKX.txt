I've been using the 300 dpi Paperwhite for over two years and decided to spoil myself with the new 32 GB WiFi Kindle Oasis E-reader. I'm an avid reader with over 500 books just on Amazon.The Kindle Oasis arrived well-packaged in an attractive sealed black box. The first thing I noticed was the sleek glassy surface and thin asymmetrical aluminum construction. Unfortunately, while the Oasis is lighter, the larger size makes it awkward to carry or slip in a pocket. The first thing I did was to buy a MoKo Case to avoid dropping and trashing my expensive new toy. The smaller Paperwhite sports a rubberized exterior providing a far more secure grip.The Oasis already had a half charge on it so it was good to go right out of the box. But there is no charger! Let me repeat that--my $300 ultra-luxury E-reader came without the standard ten dollar charger, only a short USB cord.It took five minutes to link up to my WiFi and Amazon account, adjust the local time and resurrect my library. The only instructions are on the device itself, but it's a no-brainer. Amazon had a software update available that only took a few minutes to download and reboot.The display on the Oasis has a slightly creamy tone when compared to the bright white Paperwhite. The Oasis display is perfectly even across the entire screen; the Paperwhite has a very slight "shadow" at the bottom. The 7-inch screen is significantly larger than the 6-inch Paperwhite screen. I examined the typeface through a loupe and the letters themselves appear identical on both devices.I bought my Oasis with the "special offers," but I quickly found them annoying. I removed the special offers by linking to my on-line Amazon account and coughing up an additional $20.Reading is a joy on the new Oasis. The larger screen and physical page-turn buttons allow you to read one handed and avoid the usual screen taps. The software is almost identical on both devices, though the Oasis allows you to (finally!) access audio books though Bluetooth. I couldn't get my earbuds to link, but Bluetooth is kinda touchy and I'll try it on other stuff, especially my car.One HUGE improvement is that the Oasis is waterproof! This is key for me as I read even while soaking in the tub (TMI). The Paperwhite hates even a droplet of water. One workaround for the Paperwhite is the tough Meritcase Waterproof Case, though it makes screen operation a bit clunky.IN CONCLUSION:Both the 300 dpi Paperwhite and new Kindle Oasis are terrific E-readers. If you have some "stupid money" to throw around, the Oasis is the Rolls Royce of the e-reader world, sporting an elegant waterproof construction and Bluetooth connectivity. But for normal folks, the 300 dpi Paperwhite is an excellent purchase, nearly as good with some superior features at a fraction of the price. I'm dinging the Oasis one star for the over-the-top price tag, mediocre battery life and not including a charger.
Starting with the first gen Kindle, I've owned every advanced model that Amazon has released. Each generation has been a further refinement of Amazon's design philosophy for Kindle: make the device disappear from the experience of reading. First they did it by trimming size and weight. Then came the illuminated screen, eliminating the need for separate lights. Voyager trimmed size and weight further from the Paperwhite, while adding auto-adjusting illumination. Then came the advances of last year's Oasis, which retained the same 6" screen size, but packaged it in an impossibly light, thin and small case designed to be held with one hand. Some grumbled about the battery being split between the Oasis and its cover, but the 2016 Oasis came the closest yet to disappearing while reading.Flash forward one year, and Amazon seems to have abandoned this philosophy completely with the 2017 "New" Oasis, a Kindle seemingly designed to uncomfortably remind you that you're holding a reading device in your hands. It does this in several ways. First, with a significantly bulked up size and weight--it looks and feels much bigger than you'd think compared to the 2016 Oasis, and it's just plain heavy to hold in one hand for extended periods of time. Sure, that weight is fairly well-balanced, but that's like hearing, "Oh, but it's dry heat!" when the temp hits 115 degrees.Second, the added carry-weight of the new Oasis is made worse by the very slippery feel of the new aluminum body, which forces you to grip it more tightly, and that becomes uncomfortable in longer reading sessions. This is definitely not a Kindle that ever disappears in your hands. I've seen some complaints about sharp edges, too, but that was not my experience. I've read that Amazon was going for a more "premium" feeling with this switch to aluminum, but I'm not sure what that means when every cheap tablet out of China has an aluminum body. It's also a foolish design goal for a Kindle, where priority should be given to materials that are comfortable to hold in-hand for hours at a time. And finally, this aluminum body is cold to the touch, about as unbook-like a reading experience as you can have. The ergonomics, in summary, scream to remind you that you're holding a device.So, is there anything I liked about the New Oasis? Yes, and that's what makes it especially disappointing: the 7" screen is really great, and has the immediate feeling of being the "right" size for a Kindle screen. My old Oasis and Voyager now look cramped by comparison. The larger screen somehow makes the experience of reading feel "roomier" and more relaxing--and perhaps this is just because it's closer to the page size in a real book. My new Oasis did not have the screen lighting issues some have reported but, as I've read elsewhere, the background does appear to be less white than previous Kindles, but that change actually looks more like printing on a paper page to my eye.My hope for the next gen Kindle is something like a 7" Voyager form-factor, but one that narrows bezels as much as possible for a smaller size, while using materials chosen for light weight and a comfortable feeling in the hand. In the meantime, my new Kindle Oasis will be going back to Amazon, and it's the first next-gen Kindle that I've ever returned. That should tell you a lot. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.
For the 2017 Kindle Oasis the answer seems to be yes-Heres why-One of the first things you notice, after the size increase, is the total look and feel of quality:Refined aluminum outer shell that will resist scratches.Page turn buttons-similar to the last Oasis version.Well balanced when in the hand.The lighting seems to be the best that the Kindle team has put forward yet- It seems they have taken prior criticism to heart and made a focus on making the lighting as flawless as possible.Overall fit and finish-this thing looks and feels refined. You get the same sense of quality you get when you pick up an Ipad (whether you like Apple or not).Faster page turns.Lighting/ Screen quality:Amazon must have taken poor reviews on some other models to heart and focused on eliminating these issues. Now with 12 LED bulbs, the lighting is more uniform than any prior unit. Far better than the Paperwhite (while decent for the money- the Oasis is far better). I would rank the Voyage as having a more even screen than my 2016 Oasis-The 2017 OASIS HAS THE BEST SCREEN YET).The screen has a warmer hue than the Paperwhite, Voyage or Oasis 1.No visible light cones.7 screen displays more text for less page flips.Graphics look better-small print displayed better.Inverted White/ Black option is nice change that displays less light...good for some that read in bed with partners.The Kindle team set the reading plane lower in the device(the glass is thicker) the eliminate light cones. The addition of 2 more LED units makes for the most even lighting possible.  A one inch screen size really makes a difference in the reading experience-I stopped reading on my Old Oasis and Voyage after getting this unit...ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS! While the other Kindles are fine, when you put them side by side with the Oasis...NO COMPARISON...OASIS WINS!Font boldness control, size options and Black /White color conversionKindle added more font sizes and boldness control-great for all readers-available on software update on other readers.Black /White inversion is a neat new reading option-exclusive on the Oasis.For the visually challenged:THIS IS THE DEVICE FOR YOU. Large fonts look more normal on this larger screen.Less page flips-really noticeable on larger fonts.Bold font options.about time!White /Black color inversion option. Great for nighttime readers with a partner.Magazines:This is an area that many will overlook...Magazines look better on a 7 screen than 6WeightAt 194 grams it is slightly lighter than the Paperwhite at 205grams and slightly heavier than the Voyage...In reality you can hardly feel the difference. It is however, significantly heavier than the prior Oasis model without the cove that only weighed 131 grams.Page turn buttons:Similar to last years modelMuch better than the Voyage- you can easily feel these, even in the dark.A slight click when the buttons are pushed leaves no doubt that the page will turn. These buttons really make it easy to stay focused on reading-no need to swipe the page, just klick the button. Once you get used to the buttons it is hard to go back to a Paperwhite.Asymmetrical Design:Very similar to last years model; they expanded the gripping area on the bezel to allow for wider thumbs that dont overlap the screen while in use. One the Voyage, my thumb is half on, half off the device when in use.The screen and button function auto flip when you change hands.Well balanced and secure in the hand while holding.Storage:8 gigs is plenty for most ebook readers, however if you plan to use Audible or have a large library consider paying $30 more for the 32gig model(about 27 gigs in actual use)Graphic and image heavy books can exceed 200 mg in size Examples are Manga, Comics, Cookbooks, Magazines and How to books.My library has a little over 2000 items and does not totally fit on any other Kindle device-no problem on a 32 gig Oasis!Audible:Seamless switching from reading to Audible if you own the e-book and the Audible version. They offer a 32 gig option for 30 dollars more if you plan on storing a lot of Audible books.This device does not have speakers. You need to pair it with blue tooth speakers or headphones.PLEASE NOTE THERE IS NO TEXT TO SPEECH...No e-reader on the market has this.Amazon E-book/Audible ecosystem:Simply the most extensive e-book store on the planet.Almost always the lowest price.Audible offers membership specials that can save you money.Kindle Unlimited -a exclusive option that seems to be best for inexpensive fiction books.Waterproofing:I tried this just to make sure it works  good addition.Battery:Seems to last about the same as the Voyage and charges in under 2 hours.Optional cover:Solid protection for the device. The Origami style stand is OK-not great. Consider getting a small tablet stand(Amazon carries a multitude of these).Portability:Definitely not a pocket device.Quality:10 out of 10! SIMPLY THE BESTCost:Amazon does not need to apologize for cost on this one-Sure it is twice the price of the Paperwhite (and that is a fine choice in its price range) but simply put THIS IS THE BEST KINDLE UNIT AMAZON HAS MADE TO DATE.For $50 dollars more than the Voyage you get  a bigger screen, more storage, Audible, page turn buttons, brighter screen and better display of graphics and magazines.$40 less than 2016s unit.Upgrade options:$20 to remove adds...I did to stop seeing adds and having to swipe the device to unlock it. I read a lot and would rather see the regular screen savers. I included a photo.$30 for 32 gig storage  I opted for this because I have a huge e-book and Audible library.44.99 or 59.99 -Honestly I cant recommend this-the magnets are not super secure-they hold ok...6/10 from me.4G- In this day and age many of us have wi-fi available-just store all of your books on the device. I passed on this expense.Pros:Best displayGreat for large font usersNo compromises-high qualityVast storage optionsAudiblePage turn buttonsWhite /Black inversion optionLike all Kindles you get Amazons vast ebook ecosystem-titles you will not find elsewhereCons:Portability-This device does not fit most shirt or pants pocketsCost-still $40 less than last years OasisIn short  The OASIS IS BETTER-NOT JUST BIGGERUpdate:After spending more time with the unit, I would give this device 10 out of 10 for the right user. I have owned every unit since the Kindle Keyboard and the Oasis 2 is by far the best. I stopped using my other devices after getting the Oasis-It is that much more enjoyable to read on.  Lets take a look at who this device is for:Dont buy if:You want an e-reader that easily fits in your pocket-get the Paperwhite or Voyage.You are looking for text to speech. None of the current e-readers offer this. I see poor reviews for the device because it does not have this...no current e-reader does.Budget is a priority. The Paperwhite is a fine budget friendly option.Do buy if:You want the finest e-reader available. This Kindle has the reading plane set below thicker glass to eliminate most of the light cones previous models occasionally had. The lighting is phenomenal. Page turn buttons make a difference.You want a larger reading screen that feels more like a book. E-reading immersion at its best.A visually challenged reader that uses larger fonts.You need more storage.If you can swing it -BUY IT-IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS
Just short of ten years from the date Amazon introduced the very first Amazon this 9th generation Kindle has been released. Amazon called their new device a Kindle, meaning to light a fire. (original release date was November 19, 2007; this new model October 31, 2017).Like the original Oasis this is Amazons most expensive model, but in my opinion the new features of this Oasis do justify the higher price. Customers asked Amazon for a larger display, for a waterproof Kindle, for audiobook capability  and this new model has all of those features, and more.WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE NEW OASIS?The larger display may be the most immediately noticeable difference, and the waterproof capability may be the most significant for many users, and many users will cheer that they can finally play their audiobooks with this Kindle, but for me the biggest difference is that unlike the original Oasis (https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Oasis-reader-Leather-Charging/dp/B015YKFBC2/) with the battery contained in both the Oasis and the cover, the battery for this new model is fully enclosed in the Oasis itself.This means that you can use any cover you want, and finally I have an Oasis that has a cover that folds origami style so I can read when eating or at my desk, just like my trusty old Voyage (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ/).The key differences are the following:-- larger display, 7 vs 6 for all other current Kindle models (the early Kindle DX, discontinued in 2014, had a 9.7 display).-- the display has more elements (12 vs 10 LEDs in original Oasis) for better lighting uniformity-- display brightness range is about 10% greater (brightest level is higher)-- lighting is adaptive with 2 ambient sensors (the Voyage has this capability too, but not the original Oasis)-- waterproof (first time for any Kindle)-- audiobook capability (see more detailed discussion later in this review)-- greater storage capability for both Kindle books and audiobooks  8 or 32 GB (vs 4 GB for other Kindles)-- beautiful metal (aluminum) construction, looks and feels great-- covers now provide origami folding capability for reading-- software updates provide greater variation in font sizes (14 sizes vs 8 previously) and boldness can now be varied for all fonts (5 levels of boldness; previously Amber Bold was the sole font available with Bold)-- now uses 4G LTE connectivity if that version is purchased (previously 3G)-- Amazon says this new Oasis has faster page turns (they claim up to 20% faster) due to software and display improvements (and maybe a better processor?)-- the battery is entirely within the OasisUSING THE NEW OASISThe larger size is immediately noticeable and for some people I am guessing that the 6 Kindle models may be more comfortable in the hand. I can barely reach across the face of the Oasis to pick it up, but when holding it in my hand it is comfortable and light weight.This new Oasis uses the same shape as the earlier Oasis, with a bump in the rear of the device that shifts the weight to one side. The page turn buttons are located on that side as well, so the display will automatically flip if the Oasis is turned to hold in one hand or another.HOW GOOD IS THE NEW DISPLAY?All of the earlier lighted Kindle models have had various issues with uneven lighting and customer complaints that the source of the lighting at the side or bottom of the display was distracting. I have one of the first generation Paperwhite models, a Voyage, and the original Oasis, and Ive never been bothered by the lighting or had some of the issues that some customers have experienced, but I could detect the lighting sources for those earlier models.With this new Oasis, Ive tried very hard to see if the LEDs can be detected and I do not see anything whatsoever. It is terrific, uniformly illuminated and with a glare-free display that works well indoors or outdoors.WATERPROOF?This Oasis has a waterproof rating of IPX8 which translates to protection against immersion of 1 meter or more (Amazon states up to 2 meters for 60 minutes in fresh water). I have noticed that when inserting the usb cable to charge this Oasis, it requires a more forceful push to fully engage the cable, which suggests to me that there is an internal protection within the charging port to keep water out.Amazon provides instructions with the Oasis for drying it out if it is submerged or becomes wet.No, I have not tried soaking my Oasis in the bathtub to see if it still works afterwards! I prefer to take Amazons word for it!AUDIOBOOK CAPABILITY!Amazon has had Bluetooth built into a couple of recent models, for example the current basic Kindle model has Bluetooth and can be paired with a speaker to use text-to-speech. However this is the only current model to include the ability to download Audible audiobooks onto the Oasis and then play them with paired speakers or headphones / earbuds.Once the Oasis is paired with a Bluetooth audio device, then the Oasis can be used to store audiobooks and play them whenever desired.This audiobook capability is the reason Amazon made this Oasis available with significantly more storage space than other Kindles  8 or 32 GB vs 4 GB for all other Kindles.EXPENSIVE BUT THE OPTIONS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCEI paid $309.99 for my previous Oasis, which included the leather case, without special offers and wi-fi only.This new Oasis has a base price of $249.99 but depending upon how you configure it, the price can be much higher:-- $20 to remove special offers-- $30 to upgrade to 32 GB storage-- $44.99 for fabric cover-- $59.99 for leather cover-- $50.00 for  wi-fi + cellular connectivity but if the Oasis is purchased this way then it automatically bundles with the 32 GB storage and removes special offers (separately those total $50)Some examples of Oasis prices would therefore be:-- least expensive Oasis = $294.98 (base Oasis, 8 GB, wi-fi only, special offers, fabric cover)-- least expensive Oasis with leather cover = $309.98 (base Oasis, 8 GB, wi-fi only, special offers, leather cover)-- most expensive Oasis = $409.98 (base Oasis, 32 GB, wi-fi + cellular, without special offers, leather cover)A charger / power adaptor is not included. Amazons own 5W model is $19.99 and is a bit expensive. An equally capable charger can be purchased here on Amazon for much less.
The new Oasis finally brings waterproofing that I wished my Voyage had, and personally I appreciate the Audible integration. I do hope that a software update will bring the option for immersion reading eventually, and perhaps more control over font appearance. I will not do a full review as others have already done a great job covering the Oasis's strengths, with which I fully agree. Instead I want to call attention to the serious quality control issues plaguing this latest generation of Oasis, issues that Amazon should have worked out by now after launching so many Kindles.I pre-ordered the new Oasis, and since Oct. 31st have had to get two replacements just to have a unit with an acceptable display. The first one I received had a warped case and uneven screen with washed out blurry text. The second unit was also washed out and had a stuck bright pixel. Fortunately, the third Oasis I received finally had acceptable contrast and sharpness, though it's a noticeable step down from the screen on my Voyage. The Voyage has true deep blacks and sharp text that looks like it's printed on a page. The page surface is also whiter (even with the backlight off). All of that works to produce high contrast and an enjoyable reading experience. The Oasis has more of a gray page surface and the text never gets as sharp or as black. It's much more like reading on an lcd than e-ink. I suspect the issue stems at least in part from the increase in screen size without an increase in dpi. Perhaps it could be improved with a software update (I hope!) But I think the slightly different surface of the e-ink screen will always limit the contrast on the Oasis. An additional factor is that the screen on the Oasis seems slightly more recessed from the actual glass, while the Voyage's screen is virtually right up against the glass. I think that the anti-glare coating combined with that slight recess contributes to blurrier text on the Oasis. The bezel also casts more noticeable shadows along the screen edges as a result. It's unfortunate that the R&D; team missed these details. While I like the new features the Oasis brings, I don't want to lose quality on the most important element. The screen quality should have come first above anything else!In the attached image you can see how big a difference it makes if you're lucky enough to get a "good one." The last unit I received, with the good screen, is on the left, and the previous unit is on the right. They are both on the same book, same page, same font and brightness settings (auto brightness off), but there is a major difference in brightness, evenness, and contrast.This isn't unusual for a new product, but it is extremely disappointing and frustrating if you end up with a poor quality device, especially when the replacement is crappy too! If you don't want to risk having to spend hours coordinating replacements, I would suggest waiting until Amazon improves the manufacturing and quality control for the new Oasis.
I have a Paperwhite and a Voyage and I love them both. When the 2016 Oasis was introduced, I studied it, but the mandatory cover and several reviews made me wait. When I saw that a New Oasis was being released this month, I read the specs and knew I had to have it. The Audible capability wasnt important to me; I prefer to listen on my phone. Waterproof isnt a big deal for me either, since I dont read near water; but its nice knowing that a little rain wont kill it. So I pre-ordered the 32gb...more storage, more books! I selected wi-fi only; if Im going to be away from home, I download more books than I can possibly read in one trip. I also selected with special offers; Ill remove it later if it starts to annoy me. I did not purchase a cover, because I usually remove them and they end up in the bottom of a drawer. I did purchase a no-glare screen protector, which I installed as soon I opened the box.Now for why I just love my new Oasis:*Right out of the box, it was so easy to set up! As soon as I entered my wi-fi password, it connected immediately, greeted me by name, and promptly showed my library.*The screen is more responsive. When I enter my password, there is no lag time; it responds as quickly as my phone & tablets do.*The screen size is perfect! And I dont even notice any lights; it looks like a paper page. And the page turn is immediate!*I love the feel of it in my hand. Some reviewers mentioned sharp edges, discomfort, cant hold for too long, too heavy...I notice none of those things. I usually hold in my right hand and it fits perfectly! The side rests comfortably across my hand, with my thumb resting along the edge. On the back, where the thicker portion meets the thin, it curves slightly inward, where my fingertips are completely at home. With both my Paperwhite and Voyage, I constantly shift the device as my hand tires. Not so with this Oasis! I read for hours at a time and dont tire. And when I do switch it to my left hand, its instant and seamless, no waiting for the page to adjust.*The page turn buttons...some reviews said that the buttons are too loud. Really?! When I read those comments, I had to check mine. Its a tiny click, not loud at all (mostly felt, rather than heard)! The default setting is page forward on top, page back on the bottom. I left mine at that setting since it works for me. And, if you switch to the opposite hand, those settings stay the same.*Some reviewers are unhappy with the metal back, its too slick, too slippery, too cold...again, I notice none of those things. It feels substantial, certainly classier than plastic.*I love the new font sizes, and the ability to make them bolder, as well as the capability to switch to white print on black background. I set my Oasis to auto brightness, then adjusted it down to 8. The print on the page is so vivid!*So far, the battery life is great! Ive been reading for four days now, several hours per day, and it still has about half a battery remaining. This initial charge may not be indicative of true battery life, since part of it was used in the setting up and downloading, but Im satisfied with it.Now for what I dont like about it:...Cant think of a single thing!This is definitely a keeper for me! If anything comes up that changes my opinion or reinforces my opinion, Ill update my review.(Photo shows Oasis on the left, Voyage in the center, Paperwhite on the right, demonstrating the comparative sizes.)
My 1 star reflects both the quality of the device I received and the subsequent debacle that followed to deal with it.For reference, when I refer to "store," its one of the "Amazon Books" physical locations (in my case LA) where I sampled the device and subsequently bought it.After years of enjoying my paperwhite, I thought it would be a treat to upgrade to the New Oasis.  I wasn't particularly impressed by the original oasis at its steep price point, but like many others, was immediately sold by the "new" oasis that was waterproof and had a range of other new features. For reference, I dont use audible, so have/had no opinion on those options, but I do read hours per day on  my e-reader under both dark and bright ambient lighting situations.Overall, I was in love with the new oasis.  I know some people found the ergonomics strange, but I did not find the metal slippery, nor the corners sharp, nor any of the other complaints relevant to  my personal use.  Basically, it held perfect for me.  Extremely light, and the wide side bar with page buttons allowed me to literally balance this thing on my pinky comfortably or grip it like a book, whichever was more relevant to my position.  Additionally, the auto-flip on the screen was incredibly helpful when, for example i changed sides in bed, and consequently hands.  The extra screen size was awesome, it was fast, and there are host of subtle new things that I liked, which I wont bother to list here.However the breaking point was the screen on my particular device and the debacle it led to.  The screen in the store model was beautiful.  But the device i received at purchase had an extreme color gradient and diminishing illumination horizontally across the screen.  It was very blue (similar to the paperwhite) on the thick, grip side, and yellowish on the thin side.  The text also hazed out the further you got from the grip side.  This meant that after a short time of reading, my eyes were extremely strained from going line by line through clear to hazy, clear to hazy and color temp changes.  Amazon has been making illuminated readers for some time, so tolerating this kind of extreme in a brand new $300 model is a real stretch.  My first generation paperwhite, although not perfect in its illumination consistency, was leaps beyond the quality of this oasis, and that is saying something.I understand that there can be manufacturer's defects and sometimes a lemon, so i wasn't going to let this deter me completely from the product.  I contacted Amazon.com via chat, and they were very understanding and agreed to send me a replacement.  I EXPLICITLY asked if it would be refurbished, and that I would not accept a refurbished model since I'd literally bought the thing that day.  The rep told me it would be brand new.  Imagine my surprise then when I logged into my account to find that the replacement on its way WAS a refurbished model, from a 3rd party seller.  Amazon had even used a different credit card stored on my account (one that doesnt belong to me) to "authorize" the transaction rather than the card I used for the original purchase.Needless to say, this was not ok with me.  I canceled the replacement after a great deal of wait time, and plan to return the oasis for a refund.  I'm not sure what is going on with Amazon and this new device, but if the only way they could get me a good working model without the screen issue was to send one that had been fixed (possibly with the same issue mine had? - assumption, i know, but a legitimate one) then I am not interested in having a first generation of this device at all.  I'm very disappointed because I thought the new oasis was a real contender for a worthy expensive upgrade, but due to the first device being pretty awful in the area that matters most (screen consistency and clarity) and then amazon's indifferent action to resolve it, I think I'm going to move on.  I wanted to share this as a tale of caution, if nothing else.  Obviously I could keep hounding customer service online to get a proper new one sent, or i could keep going back and forth to a store that is not particularly close to me, but I'm too disenfranchised now to bother and have lost faith that this episode wont be repeated.  I'll either wait for Amazon to get its act together with the oasis and buy a model that doesn't have technical problems that lead to consumer nightmares or I'll find something elsewhere.I want to be clear... although I am not against refurbished electronics in general, they sell for discounted prices for a reason...they are used.  I think fixing and reselling bad devices is a great way to reuse materials and avoid waste oveall.  HOWEVER,  replacing a day old device with a manufacturer's problem with a refurbished item is completely wrong, for obvious reasons.  It basically means Amazon is passing on the hit from faulty manufacturing to its most valuable consumers, the ones who were willing to shell out top dollar for a brand new model.  Instead they should be selling those bad devices, refurbished, to customers who dont care and/or are willing to get a used one for the benefit of a discount.  Its extremely disingenuous and in my case, combined with a bad screen from the get-go, was a deal breaker.
SEE MY UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEWI received my Kindle Oasis a day before the official release date (thanks UPS!) so Ive had some time to explore it already. Ive owned many Kindles throughout the years starting with the very first one (the white model with the funky liquid crystal scroll bar). I can already tell that the new Kindle Oasis is a keeper! I wont go over all of actual interface details and how the Kindle works as these are pretty similar between models. Instead I want to focus on the hardware itself and what makes the Kindle Oasis the Kindle to get!StyleThe Kindle Oasis is a high-end device and it looks like it! The front is a nice matte texture that extends all the way to the outer edges of the device and is framed by the aluminum back that creeps in from the sides to form a slight border. The screen itself is beneath this textured front so theres no edge on the screen where you can see the separate of the screen from the bezel. Its all smooth across the entire point other than the two small page turn buttons.The only other button on the unit is the sleep/wake button along the top edge.The back of the unit is a very nice dark silver aluminum with the Amazon logo printed tastefully on it. There is a slight hump on the back that takes up about a third of the total width. Im sure this is where Amazon has stashed the battery and other electronics, and it makes for a great grip for holding the unit with one hand.ControlAs I mentioned above, you can easily grip the unit with one hand using the hump on the back and then use your other hand just to support the other edge. This allows you to access the page turn buttons with your thumb. You can also flip the unit upside down if youd like to hold it with your other hand and the display will flip accordingly so your book is always right side up. The page turn buttons feel very nice and emit a very slight click when depressed. This isnt very loud but if you feel that your significant other may get annoyed with it if youre reading in bed you can always just tap the left or right side of the screen for silent page turning.The touch screen on the Kindle Oasis is very responsive and makes entering text a breeze. When you initially setup the unit you will need to enter your wi-fi password so this gives you a taste of how easy it is to enter text.Adjusting settings such as the screen brightness via the touch screen seems more responsive than on earlier models and the entire interface feels more like a tablet now. You wont get super smooth animation like with a traditional LCD display but you also wont get the eye strain either, and that tradeoff is just fine with me!Tapping the top of the display brings up the menu from any screen. From here you can quickly return to the home screen to switch books or go to the store to buy more books. You can also quickly access the most commonly used settings such as light brightness and airplane mode.Pushing the button on top of the unit puts it to sleep and, as you guessed, wakes it back up. When you wake the unit you have to do a Apple-esque swipe to unlock it. This prevents accidental button presses from waking the unit while its in your bag, purse, carrying case, etc.Overall the controls are just perfect. Amazon has put just what you need and nothing else. I really like that they have included the small physical page turn buttons rather than going with touchscreen-only controls. This gives you the option to page through your book in whichever way feels best to you.DisplayThe display is a great size and really feels like you are ready a small paperback book. The text is super crisp and looks more like paper than ever before.There are still the page refresh flickers from the eInk technology but compared to previous models they seem to be optimized now to only refresh the area of the screen that is actually changing rather than the entire page. So when you turn the page while reading the flicker is almost nonexistent unless you are changing to or from a page that has things other than standard text on it (for instance, the beginning of a new chapter that has larger fonts or stylized lettering).The lighting on the display is very even now. I had the original Kindle Paperwhite and always felt that the lighting on that model showed obvious signs of where the individual LEDs were positioned along the side of the screen. With the new Kindle Oasis you cant tell at all where the LEDs are placed. You get a very consistently even glow across the entire screen. I have noticed a VERY slight area that seems a tad brighter in one area but it isn't enough to bother me. I'll update this review if it gets worse. The display can get very bright, but more importantly it can get very dim but still be usable. This is great for reading in bed with somebody else whos already gone to sleep as you can have all the lights off in the room and have the Kindle Oasis at a brightness level that wont disturb the other person but yet still be bright enough for you to read.The one issue I have with the light is the control to adjust the brightness. Tapping the on-screen brightness control sometimes isnt very responsive. You also have to be careful if you are in the dark because if you adjust down too far the light will turn off completely and you wont be able to see the button on the screen to turn it back on.Of course if you are reading in daylight theres no need to even use the light and as always the eInk display is as easy to read in direct sunlight as paper.I really couldnt ask for anything more from the display (other than color eInk but it doesnt seem like well be getting that anytime soon). Reading on it is delightful, day or night.BatteryThe Kindle Oasis is claimed to have weeks worth of power from a single charge and although I havent been able to test this since I just got the unit I have no reason to doubt this claim based on past Kindles. The display technology is very power efficient and its this battery longevity long with the superior display that really make the Kindle Oasis a great alternative to reading books on your phone or tablet.The unit charges through a standard micro-USB connection so if you already have cables and chargers for micro-USB you can use them with your Kindle Oasis as well.WeightDespite having a gorgeous metal back the Kindle Oasis still manages to feel light in the hand. Holding it for reading is no problem. Holding it with one hand may get a little tiresome after awhile but you can comfortably hold it with two hands with hardly any effort at all.WaterproofingOf course one of the big new features with the Kindle Oasis is its waterproofing. I havent tried this and hope not to, but its nice to know that it should survive an accidental dip in the pool or splash from the ocean when youre reading on vacation. One of the few actual printed instructions that comes in the box is a note explaining how to drain the unit if you get it wet and how to wash it out with clean water if you happen to get it in salt water or some other potentially damaging liquid. The note stresses that just because its waterproof doesnt mean that you should use it underwater, so any dreams  of reading while snorkeling are going to have to remain dreams for now.SummaryThis is a premium device and it shows. If you are looking for a Kindle and can afford the extra cost for this one then dont hesitate. Theres no better way to read eBooks. Amazon has taken all my wishlist items such as premium materials, touchscreen while still having physical page turn buttons, high resolution display in a great size and aspect ratio, very even and controllable lighting, waterproofing, and good overall design, and cranked out their best product ever.Verdict: Buy it now!UPDATE 11/8/17: After reading with the Kindle Oasis for a week the bright spot in the lower right corner is really bugging me. It seems to persist regardless of which level of lighting I select. It's noticeably brighter in a circular area and then the light seems to fall off gradually to match the rest of the screen. Because of this I'm considering returning the unit and just getting a Voyage or Paperwhite. Stay tuned.UPDATE 11/10/17: The bright spot on the screen really bothered me, especially with this being a premium device. If it wasn't so expensive I could excuse the bright spot, but at this price level I really expect it to be flawless. I could attempt to exchange for a different unit but my experience in the past is that the replacement unit may have even more screen flaws and Amazon will not continually replace the device when the issues fall within what they consider acceptable (I may just be super sensitive - most people may not even notice a difference). I have instead opted for the Kindle Paperwhite for less than half the price of the Oasis. The Paperwhite definitely has light issues as well, but they are mainly along the bottom of the screen and in specific areas that don't really bother me since they bright spot doesn't overlay the text area. I have also found that the Paperwhite display is actually "whiter" than the Oasis (see attached comparison picture). I had both units set on the same brightness and to me the Paperwhite is a more pleasant shade for reading.Sure, the Paperwhite isn't waterproof, isn't quite as zippy when turning pages (talking milliseconds difference), is a little smaller, doesn't have as much storage (which doesn't really matter unless you need a ton of books available when you are away from wi-fi) ,and weighs a measly 5 grams more, but for my money the Paperwhite is the better device when you factor in the cost. I also like that the Paperwhite has the rubberized back and that the back is the same thickness on both sides. It feels easier to hold.So, while I stand by my original review that the Oasis is the best Kindle yet, the light bright spot coupled with the much higher price lead me to suggest the Paperwhite for most readers.
Great e-reader, but abysmal battery life. I bought mine from another retailer, because Amazon's wait time was too long and I wanted it for a long trip that started the following day.The screen is gorgeous, page turns are fast, lighting is even, the weight and balance are excellent.But all of that doesn't mean much if battery life is just a few (and I mean FEW) hours. I've had a Kindle Paperwhite and a first generation Oasis as well; this new one has the worst battery life by a lot.I have had a Kindle Oasis 2017 (32GB with Cellular) since 3 November. I'm very unimpressed with the battery life. In airplane mode, I think it lasted about 8 hours, brightness no higher than 8 and frequently at 2 or 3. With Cellular on, it was maybe 2-3 hours? I didn't track it, at that time.After the third full charge, I put it on WiFi, and it's had a good signal. I did also make sure it was not stuck indexing. My results from full charge to ! Battery depleted was under four hours. This time I tracked it; see below for brightness levels etc. Next testing will be with in airplane mode, with time and brightness tracked. I got this for travel/long flights, and this is NOT what I expected.Kindle Oasis 2017 battery lifeFull charge.

I am in love with this Kindle!  I am an avid reader that does most of my reading on my Kindle.  I have been using different Kindle devices since 2010 or so.  I have a Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Basic, Paperwhite, Voyage, and a Fire that I use at different times.  Each device has features that I like and over the years, I have had several things that I knew I would like to see in a device.  The first Oasis didn't have any real appeal for me but the moment I saw the specs for this version, I knew that I would have to add it to my collection.There are two features on this Oasis that came straight from my personal wish list.  The first is the larger screen size.  I have probably told my husband at least once per week that I would like a bigger Kindle.  Every single new release has had the same 6" screen with the expection of the DX which has not been made for some time and the Fires which I do like to use for reading.  The 7" screen is wonderful.  It is bigger without being cumbersome to handle.  The actual device is not much larger than my Voyage or Paperwhite.  It is a bit wider but the height is fairly equal.  The difference is that there is less of a frame around the screen.I was also very pleased to find page turn buttons on this device.  My Kindle Keyboard and Kindle Basic had this feature but the more recent trend has been a touchscreen such as with the Paperwhite.  I thought that I would like the page press on the Voyage but I found that it was the same as a physical button.  I have already read a novel on my new Oasis and loved being able to press a button to turn the page.  You can still turn pages with the touchscreen if you prefer but I am happy to have the buttons.  You do have to use the touchscreen for other commands and to access the menu features.I like that this Kindle has an aluminum back.  I think it feels like a much more solid e-reader and it feels nice in my hands.  I have not purchased a case for this device yet and have held it in one hand while reading.  It has felt very comfortable and natural.  I am also intrigued by the ability to invert the black and white on the device so the the print is white on a black background.  I did try this feature out just a bit and am not sure how much I will end up using it.  I am still happy to know that it is an option.I have not used the Audible feature on the device.  I do wish that the device had a headphone jack since I have a pair corded headphones that I love.  I am not going to purchase bluetooth headphones just to listen to my audiobooks on this device.  I listen to a lot of Audible audiobooks and have no issue doing so with my cell phone. I think that the size of this device would make it somewhat awkward to carry around in order to listen to my books.  I will be sticking to my cell phone for audiobooks for right now.  If I change my mind, it is nice to know that the device has the capabilities.I can easily say that the Oasis is my favorite Kindle that I have owned.  I like just about everything about it.  The clear and crisp screen is a very nice size, the page turn buttons are perfectly positioned, and the aluminum backing looks and feels nice. I bought the 32 GB device with cell connectivity and am looking forward to spending many quality reading hours with my new Oasis.
I've been using the 300 dpi Paperwhite for over two years and decided to spoil myself with the new 32 GB WiFi Kindle Oasis E-reader. I'm an avid reader with over 500 books just on Amazon.The Kindle Oasis arrived well-packaged in an attractive sealed black box. The first thing I noticed was the sleek glassy surface and thin asymmetrical aluminum construction. Unfortunately, while the Oasis is lighter, the larger size makes it awkward to carry or slip in a pocket. The first thing I did was to buy a MoKo Case to avoid dropping and trashing my expensive new toy. The smaller Paperwhite sports a rubberized exterior providing a far more secure grip.The Oasis already had a half charge on it so it was good to go right out of the box. But there is no charger! Let me repeat that--my $300 ultra-luxury E-reader came without the standard ten dollar charger, only a short USB cord.It took five minutes to link up to my WiFi and Amazon account, adjust the local time and resurrect my library. The only instructions are on the device itself, but it's a no-brainer. Amazon had a software update available that only took a few minutes to download and reboot.The display on the Oasis has a slightly creamy tone when compared to the bright white Paperwhite. The Oasis display is perfectly even across the entire screen; the Paperwhite has a very slight "shadow" at the bottom. The 7-inch screen is significantly larger than the 6-inch Paperwhite screen. I examined the typeface through a loupe and the letters themselves appear identical on both devices.I bought my Oasis with the "special offers," but I quickly found them annoying. I removed the special offers by linking to my on-line Amazon account and coughing up an additional $20.Reading is a joy on the new Oasis. The larger screen and physical page-turn buttons allow you to read one handed and avoid the usual screen taps. The software is almost identical on both devices, though the Oasis allows you to (finally!) access audio books though Bluetooth. I couldn't get my earbuds to link, but Bluetooth is kinda touchy and I'll try it on other stuff, especially my car.One HUGE improvement is that the Oasis is waterproof! This is key for me as I read even while soaking in the tub (TMI). The Paperwhite hates even a droplet of water. One workaround for the Paperwhite is the tough Meritcase Waterproof Case, though it makes screen operation a bit clunky.IN CONCLUSION:Both the 300 dpi Paperwhite and new Kindle Oasis are terrific E-readers. If you have some "stupid money" to throw around, the Oasis is the Rolls Royce of the e-reader world, sporting an elegant waterproof construction and Bluetooth connectivity. But for normal folks, the 300 dpi Paperwhite is an excellent purchase, nearly as good with some superior features at a fraction of the price. I'm dinging the Oasis one star for the over-the-top price tag, mediocre battery life and not including a charger.
Starting with the first gen Kindle, I've owned every advanced model that Amazon has released. Each generation has been a further refinement of Amazon's design philosophy for Kindle: make the device disappear from the experience of reading. First they did it by trimming size and weight. Then came the illuminated screen, eliminating the need for separate lights. Voyager trimmed size and weight further from the Paperwhite, while adding auto-adjusting illumination. Then came the advances of last year's Oasis, which retained the same 6" screen size, but packaged it in an impossibly light, thin and small case designed to be held with one hand. Some grumbled about the battery being split between the Oasis and its cover, but the 2016 Oasis came the closest yet to disappearing while reading.Flash forward one year, and Amazon seems to have abandoned this philosophy completely with the 2017 "New" Oasis, a Kindle seemingly designed to uncomfortably remind you that you're holding a reading device in your hands. It does this in several ways. First, with a significantly bulked up size and weight--it looks and feels much bigger than you'd think compared to the 2016 Oasis, and it's just plain heavy to hold in one hand for extended periods of time. Sure, that weight is fairly well-balanced, but that's like hearing, "Oh, but it's dry heat!" when the temp hits 115 degrees.Second, the added carry-weight of the new Oasis is made worse by the very slippery feel of the new aluminum body, which forces you to grip it more tightly, and that becomes uncomfortable in longer reading sessions. This is definitely not a Kindle that ever disappears in your hands. I've seen some complaints about sharp edges, too, but that was not my experience. I've read that Amazon was going for a more "premium" feeling with this switch to aluminum, but I'm not sure what that means when every cheap tablet out of China has an aluminum body. It's also a foolish design goal for a Kindle, where priority should be given to materials that are comfortable to hold in-hand for hours at a time. And finally, this aluminum body is cold to the touch, about as unbook-like a reading experience as you can have. The ergonomics, in summary, scream to remind you that you're holding a device.So, is there anything I liked about the New Oasis? Yes, and that's what makes it especially disappointing: the 7" screen is really great, and has the immediate feeling of being the "right" size for a Kindle screen. My old Oasis and Voyager now look cramped by comparison. The larger screen somehow makes the experience of reading feel "roomier" and more relaxing--and perhaps this is just because it's closer to the page size in a real book. My new Oasis did not have the screen lighting issues some have reported but, as I've read elsewhere, the background does appear to be less white than previous Kindles, but that change actually looks more like printing on a paper page to my eye.My hope for the next gen Kindle is something like a 7" Voyager form-factor, but one that narrows bezels as much as possible for a smaller size, while using materials chosen for light weight and a comfortable feeling in the hand. In the meantime, my new Kindle Oasis will be going back to Amazon, and it's the first next-gen Kindle that I've ever returned. That should tell you a lot. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.
For the 2017 Kindle Oasis the answer seems to be yes-Heres why-One of the first things you notice, after the size increase, is the total look and feel of quality:Refined aluminum outer shell that will resist scratches.Page turn buttons-similar to the last Oasis version.Well balanced when in the hand.The lighting seems to be the best that the Kindle team has put forward yet- It seems they have taken prior criticism to heart and made a focus on making the lighting as flawless as possible.Overall fit and finish-this thing looks and feels refined. You get the same sense of quality you get when you pick up an Ipad (whether you like Apple or not).Faster page turns.Lighting/ Screen quality:Amazon must have taken poor reviews on some other models to heart and focused on eliminating these issues. Now with 12 LED bulbs, the lighting is more uniform than any prior unit. Far better than the Paperwhite (while decent for the money- the Oasis is far better). I would rank the Voyage as having a more even screen than my 2016 Oasis-The 2017 OASIS HAS THE BEST SCREEN YET).The screen has a warmer hue than the Paperwhite, Voyage or Oasis 1.No visible light cones.7 screen displays more text for less page flips.Graphics look better-small print displayed better.Inverted White/ Black option is nice change that displays less light...good for some that read in bed with partners.The Kindle team set the reading plane lower in the device(the glass is thicker) the eliminate light cones. The addition of 2 more LED units makes for the most even lighting possible.  A one inch screen size really makes a difference in the reading experience-I stopped reading on my Old Oasis and Voyage after getting this unit...ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS! While the other Kindles are fine, when you put them side by side with the Oasis...NO COMPARISON...OASIS WINS!Font boldness control, size options and Black /White color conversionKindle added more font sizes and boldness control-great for all readers-available on software update on other readers.Black /White inversion is a neat new reading option-exclusive on the Oasis.For the visually challenged:THIS IS THE DEVICE FOR YOU. Large fonts look more normal on this larger screen.Less page flips-really noticeable on larger fonts.Bold font options.about time!White /Black color inversion option. Great for nighttime readers with a partner.Magazines:This is an area that many will overlook...Magazines look better on a 7 screen than 6WeightAt 194 grams it is slightly lighter than the Paperwhite at 205grams and slightly heavier than the Voyage...In reality you can hardly feel the difference. It is however, significantly heavier than the prior Oasis model without the cove that only weighed 131 grams.Page turn buttons:Similar to last years modelMuch better than the Voyage- you can easily feel these, even in the dark.A slight click when the buttons are pushed leaves no doubt that the page will turn. These buttons really make it easy to stay focused on reading-no need to swipe the page, just klick the button. Once you get used to the buttons it is hard to go back to a Paperwhite.Asymmetrical Design:Very similar to last years model; they expanded the gripping area on the bezel to allow for wider thumbs that dont overlap the screen while in use. One the Voyage, my thumb is half on, half off the device when in use.The screen and button function auto flip when you change hands.Well balanced and secure in the hand while holding.Storage:8 gigs is plenty for most ebook readers, however if you plan to use Audible or have a large library consider paying $30 more for the 32gig model(about 27 gigs in actual use)Graphic and image heavy books can exceed 200 mg in size Examples are Manga, Comics, Cookbooks, Magazines and How to books.My library has a little over 2000 items and does not totally fit on any other Kindle device-no problem on a 32 gig Oasis!Audible:Seamless switching from reading to Audible if you own the e-book and the Audible version. They offer a 32 gig option for 30 dollars more if you plan on storing a lot of Audible books.This device does not have speakers. You need to pair it with blue tooth speakers or headphones.PLEASE NOTE THERE IS NO TEXT TO SPEECH...No e-reader on the market has this.Amazon E-book/Audible ecosystem:Simply the most extensive e-book store on the planet.Almost always the lowest price.Audible offers membership specials that can save you money.Kindle Unlimited -a exclusive option that seems to be best for inexpensive fiction books.Waterproofing:I tried this just to make sure it works  good addition.Battery:Seems to last about the same as the Voyage and charges in under 2 hours.Optional cover:Solid protection for the device. The Origami style stand is OK-not great. Consider getting a small tablet stand(Amazon carries a multitude of these).Portability:Definitely not a pocket device.Quality:10 out of 10! SIMPLY THE BESTCost:Amazon does not need to apologize for cost on this one-Sure it is twice the price of the Paperwhite (and that is a fine choice in its price range) but simply put THIS IS THE BEST KINDLE UNIT AMAZON HAS MADE TO DATE.For $50 dollars more than the Voyage you get  a bigger screen, more storage, Audible, page turn buttons, brighter screen and better display of graphics and magazines.$40 less than 2016s unit.Upgrade options:$20 to remove adds...I did to stop seeing adds and having to swipe the device to unlock it. I read a lot and would rather see the regular screen savers. I included a photo.$30 for 32 gig storage  I opted for this because I have a huge e-book and Audible library.44.99 or 59.99 -Honestly I cant recommend this-the magnets are not super secure-they hold ok...6/10 from me.4G- In this day and age many of us have wi-fi available-just store all of your books on the device. I passed on this expense.Pros:Best displayGreat for large font usersNo compromises-high qualityVast storage optionsAudiblePage turn buttonsWhite /Black inversion optionLike all Kindles you get Amazons vast ebook ecosystem-titles you will not find elsewhereCons:Portability-This device does not fit most shirt or pants pocketsCost-still $40 less than last years OasisIn short  The OASIS IS BETTER-NOT JUST BIGGERUpdate:After spending more time with the unit, I would give this device 10 out of 10 for the right user. I have owned every unit since the Kindle Keyboard and the Oasis 2 is by far the best. I stopped using my other devices after getting the Oasis-It is that much more enjoyable to read on.  Lets take a look at who this device is for:Dont buy if:You want an e-reader that easily fits in your pocket-get the Paperwhite or Voyage.You are looking for text to speech. None of the current e-readers offer this. I see poor reviews for the device because it does not have this...no current e-reader does.Budget is a priority. The Paperwhite is a fine budget friendly option.Do buy if:You want the finest e-reader available. This Kindle has the reading plane set below thicker glass to eliminate most of the light cones previous models occasionally had. The lighting is phenomenal. Page turn buttons make a difference.You want a larger reading screen that feels more like a book. E-reading immersion at its best.A visually challenged reader that uses larger fonts.You need more storage.If you can swing it -BUY IT-IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS
Just short of ten years from the date Amazon introduced the very first Amazon this 9th generation Kindle has been released. Amazon called their new device a Kindle, meaning to light a fire. (original release date was November 19, 2007; this new model October 31, 2017).Like the original Oasis this is Amazons most expensive model, but in my opinion the new features of this Oasis do justify the higher price. Customers asked Amazon for a larger display, for a waterproof Kindle, for audiobook capability  and this new model has all of those features, and more.WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE NEW OASIS?The larger display may be the most immediately noticeable difference, and the waterproof capability may be the most significant for many users, and many users will cheer that they can finally play their audiobooks with this Kindle, but for me the biggest difference is that unlike the original Oasis (https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Oasis-reader-Leather-Charging/dp/B015YKFBC2/) with the battery contained in both the Oasis and the cover, the battery for this new model is fully enclosed in the Oasis itself.This means that you can use any cover you want, and finally I have an Oasis that has a cover that folds origami style so I can read when eating or at my desk, just like my trusty old Voyage (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ/).The key differences are the following:-- larger display, 7 vs 6 for all other current Kindle models (the early Kindle DX, discontinued in 2014, had a 9.7 display).-- the display has more elements (12 vs 10 LEDs in original Oasis) for better lighting uniformity-- display brightness range is about 10% greater (brightest level is higher)-- lighting is adaptive with 2 ambient sensors (the Voyage has this capability too, but not the original Oasis)-- waterproof (first time for any Kindle)-- audiobook capability (see more detailed discussion later in this review)-- greater storage capability for both Kindle books and audiobooks  8 or 32 GB (vs 4 GB for other Kindles)-- beautiful metal (aluminum) construction, looks and feels great-- covers now provide origami folding capability for reading-- software updates provide greater variation in font sizes (14 sizes vs 8 previously) and boldness can now be varied for all fonts (5 levels of boldness; previously Amber Bold was the sole font available with Bold)-- now uses 4G LTE connectivity if that version is purchased (previously 3G)-- Amazon says this new Oasis has faster page turns (they claim up to 20% faster) due to software and display improvements (and maybe a better processor?)-- the battery is entirely within the OasisUSING THE NEW OASISThe larger size is immediately noticeable and for some people I am guessing that the 6 Kindle models may be more comfortable in the hand. I can barely reach across the face of the Oasis to pick it up, but when holding it in my hand it is comfortable and light weight.This new Oasis uses the same shape as the earlier Oasis, with a bump in the rear of the device that shifts the weight to one side. The page turn buttons are located on that side as well, so the display will automatically flip if the Oasis is turned to hold in one hand or another.HOW GOOD IS THE NEW DISPLAY?All of the earlier lighted Kindle models have had various issues with uneven lighting and customer complaints that the source of the lighting at the side or bottom of the display was distracting. I have one of the first generation Paperwhite models, a Voyage, and the original Oasis, and Ive never been bothered by the lighting or had some of the issues that some customers have experienced, but I could detect the lighting sources for those earlier models.With this new Oasis, Ive tried very hard to see if the LEDs can be detected and I do not see anything whatsoever. It is terrific, uniformly illuminated and with a glare-free display that works well indoors or outdoors.WATERPROOF?This Oasis has a waterproof rating of IPX8 which translates to protection against immersion of 1 meter or more (Amazon states up to 2 meters for 60 minutes in fresh water). I have noticed that when inserting the usb cable to charge this Oasis, it requires a more forceful push to fully engage the cable, which suggests to me that there is an internal protection within the charging port to keep water out.Amazon provides instructions with the Oasis for drying it out if it is submerged or becomes wet.No, I have not tried soaking my Oasis in the bathtub to see if it still works afterwards! I prefer to take Amazons word for it!AUDIOBOOK CAPABILITY!Amazon has had Bluetooth built into a couple of recent models, for example the current basic Kindle model has Bluetooth and can be paired with a speaker to use text-to-speech. However this is the only current model to include the ability to download Audible audiobooks onto the Oasis and then play them with paired speakers or headphones / earbuds.Once the Oasis is paired with a Bluetooth audio device, then the Oasis can be used to store audiobooks and play them whenever desired.This audiobook capability is the reason Amazon made this Oasis available with significantly more storage space than other Kindles  8 or 32 GB vs 4 GB for all other Kindles.EXPENSIVE BUT THE OPTIONS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCEI paid $309.99 for my previous Oasis, which included the leather case, without special offers and wi-fi only.This new Oasis has a base price of $249.99 but depending upon how you configure it, the price can be much higher:-- $20 to remove special offers-- $30 to upgrade to 32 GB storage-- $44.99 for fabric cover-- $59.99 for leather cover-- $50.00 for  wi-fi + cellular connectivity but if the Oasis is purchased this way then it automatically bundles with the 32 GB storage and removes special offers (separately those total $50)Some examples of Oasis prices would therefore be:-- least expensive Oasis = $294.98 (base Oasis, 8 GB, wi-fi only, special offers, fabric cover)-- least expensive Oasis with leather cover = $309.98 (base Oasis, 8 GB, wi-fi only, special offers, leather cover)-- most expensive Oasis = $409.98 (base Oasis, 32 GB, wi-fi + cellular, without special offers, leather cover)A charger / power adaptor is not included. Amazons own 5W model is $19.99 and is a bit expensive. An equally capable charger can be purchased here on Amazon for much less.
The new Oasis finally brings waterproofing that I wished my Voyage had, and personally I appreciate the Audible integration. I do hope that a software update will bring the option for immersion reading eventually, and perhaps more control over font appearance. I will not do a full review as others have already done a great job covering the Oasis's strengths, with which I fully agree. Instead I want to call attention to the serious quality control issues plaguing this latest generation of Oasis, issues that Amazon should have worked out by now after launching so many Kindles.I pre-ordered the new Oasis, and since Oct. 31st have had to get two replacements just to have a unit with an acceptable display. The first one I received had a warped case and uneven screen with washed out blurry text. The second unit was also washed out and had a stuck bright pixel. Fortunately, the third Oasis I received finally had acceptable contrast and sharpness, though it's a noticeable step down from the screen on my Voyage. The Voyage has true deep blacks and sharp text that looks like it's printed on a page. The page surface is also whiter (even with the backlight off). All of that works to produce high contrast and an enjoyable reading experience. The Oasis has more of a gray page surface and the text never gets as sharp or as black. It's much more like reading on an lcd than e-ink. I suspect the issue stems at least in part from the increase in screen size without an increase in dpi. Perhaps it could be improved with a software update (I hope!) But I think the slightly different surface of the e-ink screen will always limit the contrast on the Oasis. An additional factor is that the screen on the Oasis seems slightly more recessed from the actual glass, while the Voyage's screen is virtually right up against the glass. I think that the anti-glare coating combined with that slight recess contributes to blurrier text on the Oasis. The bezel also casts more noticeable shadows along the screen edges as a result. It's unfortunate that the R&D; team missed these details. While I like the new features the Oasis brings, I don't want to lose quality on the most important element. The screen quality should have come first above anything else!In the attached image you can see how big a difference it makes if you're lucky enough to get a "good one." The last unit I received, with the good screen, is on the left, and the previous unit is on the right. They are both on the same book, same page, same font and brightness settings (auto brightness off), but there is a major difference in brightness, evenness, and contrast.This isn't unusual for a new product, but it is extremely disappointing and frustrating if you end up with a poor quality device, especially when the replacement is crappy too! If you don't want to risk having to spend hours coordinating replacements, I would suggest waiting until Amazon improves the manufacturing and quality control for the new Oasis.
I have a Paperwhite and a Voyage and I love them both. When the 2016 Oasis was introduced, I studied it, but the mandatory cover and several reviews made me wait. When I saw that a New Oasis was being released this month, I read the specs and knew I had to have it. The Audible capability wasnt important to me; I prefer to listen on my phone. Waterproof isnt a big deal for me either, since I dont read near water; but its nice knowing that a little rain wont kill it. So I pre-ordered the 32gb...more storage, more books! I selected wi-fi only; if Im going to be away from home, I download more books than I can possibly read in one trip. I also selected with special offers; Ill remove it later if it starts to annoy me. I did not purchase a cover, because I usually remove them and they end up in the bottom of a drawer. I did purchase a no-glare screen protector, which I installed as soon I opened the box.Now for why I just love my new Oasis:*Right out of the box, it was so easy to set up! As soon as I entered my wi-fi password, it connected immediately, greeted me by name, and promptly showed my library.*The screen is more responsive. When I enter my password, there is no lag time; it responds as quickly as my phone & tablets do.*The screen size is perfect! And I dont even notice any lights; it looks like a paper page. And the page turn is immediate!*I love the feel of it in my hand. Some reviewers mentioned sharp edges, discomfort, cant hold for too long, too heavy...I notice none of those things. I usually hold in my right hand and it fits perfectly! The side rests comfortably across my hand, with my thumb resting along the edge. On the back, where the thicker portion meets the thin, it curves slightly inward, where my fingertips are completely at home. With both my Paperwhite and Voyage, I constantly shift the device as my hand tires. Not so with this Oasis! I read for hours at a time and dont tire. And when I do switch it to my left hand, its instant and seamless, no waiting for the page to adjust.*The page turn buttons...some reviews said that the buttons are too loud. Really?! When I read those comments, I had to check mine. Its a tiny click, not loud at all (mostly felt, rather than heard)! The default setting is page forward on top, page back on the bottom. I left mine at that setting since it works for me. And, if you switch to the opposite hand, those settings stay the same.*Some reviewers are unhappy with the metal back, its too slick, too slippery, too cold...again, I notice none of those things. It feels substantial, certainly classier than plastic.*I love the new font sizes, and the ability to make them bolder, as well as the capability to switch to white print on black background. I set my Oasis to auto brightness, then adjusted it down to 8. The print on the page is so vivid!*So far, the battery life is great! Ive been reading for four days now, several hours per day, and it still has about half a battery remaining. This initial charge may not be indicative of true battery life, since part of it was used in the setting up and downloading, but Im satisfied with it.Now for what I dont like about it:...Cant think of a single thing!This is definitely a keeper for me! If anything comes up that changes my opinion or reinforces my opinion, Ill update my review.(Photo shows Oasis on the left, Voyage in the center, Paperwhite on the right, demonstrating the comparative sizes.)
My 1 star reflects both the quality of the device I received and the subsequent debacle that followed to deal with it.For reference, when I refer to "store," its one of the "Amazon Books" physical locations (in my case LA) where I sampled the device and subsequently bought it.After years of enjoying my paperwhite, I thought it would be a treat to upgrade to the New Oasis.  I wasn't particularly impressed by the original oasis at its steep price point, but like many others, was immediately sold by the "new" oasis that was waterproof and had a range of other new features. For reference, I dont use audible, so have/had no opinion on those options, but I do read hours per day on  my e-reader under both dark and bright ambient lighting situations.Overall, I was in love with the new oasis.  I know some people found the ergonomics strange, but I did not find the metal slippery, nor the corners sharp, nor any of the other complaints relevant to  my personal use.  Basically, it held perfect for me.  Extremely light, and the wide side bar with page buttons allowed me to literally balance this thing on my pinky comfortably or grip it like a book, whichever was more relevant to my position.  Additionally, the auto-flip on the screen was incredibly helpful when, for example i changed sides in bed, and consequently hands.  The extra screen size was awesome, it was fast, and there are host of subtle new things that I liked, which I wont bother to list here.However the breaking point was the screen on my particular device and the debacle it led to.  The screen in the store model was beautiful.  But the device i received at purchase had an extreme color gradient and diminishing illumination horizontally across the screen.  It was very blue (similar to the paperwhite) on the thick, grip side, and yellowish on the thin side.  The text also hazed out the further you got from the grip side.  This meant that after a short time of reading, my eyes were extremely strained from going line by line through clear to hazy, clear to hazy and color temp changes.  Amazon has been making illuminated readers for some time, so tolerating this kind of extreme in a brand new $300 model is a real stretch.  My first generation paperwhite, although not perfect in its illumination consistency, was leaps beyond the quality of this oasis, and that is saying something.I understand that there can be manufacturer's defects and sometimes a lemon, so i wasn't going to let this deter me completely from the product.  I contacted Amazon.com via chat, and they were very understanding and agreed to send me a replacement.  I EXPLICITLY asked if it would be refurbished, and that I would not accept a refurbished model since I'd literally bought the thing that day.  The rep told me it would be brand new.  Imagine my surprise then when I logged into my account to find that the replacement on its way WAS a refurbished model, from a 3rd party seller.  Amazon had even used a different credit card stored on my account (one that doesnt belong to me) to "authorize" the transaction rather than the card I used for the original purchase.Needless to say, this was not ok with me.  I canceled the replacement after a great deal of wait time, and plan to return the oasis for a refund.  I'm not sure what is going on with Amazon and this new device, but if the only way they could get me a good working model without the screen issue was to send one that had been fixed (possibly with the same issue mine had? - assumption, i know, but a legitimate one) then I am not interested in having a first generation of this device at all.  I'm very disappointed because I thought the new oasis was a real contender for a worthy expensive upgrade, but due to the first device being pretty awful in the area that matters most (screen consistency and clarity) and then amazon's indifferent action to resolve it, I think I'm going to move on.  I wanted to share this as a tale of caution, if nothing else.  Obviously I could keep hounding customer service online to get a proper new one sent, or i could keep going back and forth to a store that is not particularly close to me, but I'm too disenfranchised now to bother and have lost faith that this episode wont be repeated.  I'll either wait for Amazon to get its act together with the oasis and buy a model that doesn't have technical problems that lead to consumer nightmares or I'll find something elsewhere.I want to be clear... although I am not against refurbished electronics in general, they sell for discounted prices for a reason...they are used.  I think fixing and reselling bad devices is a great way to reuse materials and avoid waste oveall.  HOWEVER,  replacing a day old device with a manufacturer's problem with a refurbished item is completely wrong, for obvious reasons.  It basically means Amazon is passing on the hit from faulty manufacturing to its most valuable consumers, the ones who were willing to shell out top dollar for a brand new model.  Instead they should be selling those bad devices, refurbished, to customers who dont care and/or are willing to get a used one for the benefit of a discount.  Its extremely disingenuous and in my case, combined with a bad screen from the get-go, was a deal breaker.
SEE MY UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEWI received my Kindle Oasis a day before the official release date (thanks UPS!) so Ive had some time to explore it already. Ive owned many Kindles throughout the years starting with the very first one (the white model with the funky liquid crystal scroll bar). I can already tell that the new Kindle Oasis is a keeper! I wont go over all of actual interface details and how the Kindle works as these are pretty similar between models. Instead I want to focus on the hardware itself and what makes the Kindle Oasis the Kindle to get!StyleThe Kindle Oasis is a high-end device and it looks like it! The front is a nice matte texture that extends all the way to the outer edges of the device and is framed by the aluminum back that creeps in from the sides to form a slight border. The screen itself is beneath this textured front so theres no edge on the screen where you can see the separate of the screen from the bezel. Its all smooth across the entire point other than the two small page turn buttons.The only other button on the unit is the sleep/wake button along the top edge.The back of the unit is a very nice dark silver aluminum with the Amazon logo printed tastefully on it. There is a slight hump on the back that takes up about a third of the total width. Im sure this is where Amazon has stashed the battery and other electronics, and it makes for a great grip for holding the unit with one hand.ControlAs I mentioned above, you can easily grip the unit with one hand using the hump on the back and then use your other hand just to support the other edge. This allows you to access the page turn buttons with your thumb. You can also flip the unit upside down if youd like to hold it with your other hand and the display will flip accordingly so your book is always right side up. The page turn buttons feel very nice and emit a very slight click when depressed. This isnt very loud but if you feel that your significant other may get annoyed with it if youre reading in bed you can always just tap the left or right side of the screen for silent page turning.The touch screen on the Kindle Oasis is very responsive and makes entering text a breeze. When you initially setup the unit you will need to enter your wi-fi password so this gives you a taste of how easy it is to enter text.Adjusting settings such as the screen brightness via the touch screen seems more responsive than on earlier models and the entire interface feels more like a tablet now. You wont get super smooth animation like with a traditional LCD display but you also wont get the eye strain either, and that tradeoff is just fine with me!Tapping the top of the display brings up the menu from any screen. From here you can quickly return to the home screen to switch books or go to the store to buy more books. You can also quickly access the most commonly used settings such as light brightness and airplane mode.Pushing the button on top of the unit puts it to sleep and, as you guessed, wakes it back up. When you wake the unit you have to do a Apple-esque swipe to unlock it. This prevents accidental button presses from waking the unit while its in your bag, purse, carrying case, etc.Overall the controls are just perfect. Amazon has put just what you need and nothing else. I really like that they have included the small physical page turn buttons rather than going with touchscreen-only controls. This gives you the option to page through your book in whichever way feels best to you.DisplayThe display is a great size and really feels like you are ready a small paperback book. The text is super crisp and looks more like paper than ever before.There are still the page refresh flickers from the eInk technology but compared to previous models they seem to be optimized now to only refresh the area of the screen that is actually changing rather than the entire page. So when you turn the page while reading the flicker is almost nonexistent unless you are changing to or from a page that has things other than standard text on it (for instance, the beginning of a new chapter that has larger fonts or stylized lettering).The lighting on the display is very even now. I had the original Kindle Paperwhite and always felt that the lighting on that model showed obvious signs of where the individual LEDs were positioned along the side of the screen. With the new Kindle Oasis you cant tell at all where the LEDs are placed. You get a very consistently even glow across the entire screen. I have noticed a VERY slight area that seems a tad brighter in one area but it isn't enough to bother me. I'll update this review if it gets worse. The display can get very bright, but more importantly it can get very dim but still be usable. This is great for reading in bed with somebody else whos already gone to sleep as you can have all the lights off in the room and have the Kindle Oasis at a brightness level that wont disturb the other person but yet still be bright enough for you to read.The one issue I have with the light is the control to adjust the brightness. Tapping the on-screen brightness control sometimes isnt very responsive. You also have to be careful if you are in the dark because if you adjust down too far the light will turn off completely and you wont be able to see the button on the screen to turn it back on.Of course if you are reading in daylight theres no need to even use the light and as always the eInk display is as easy to read in direct sunlight as paper.I really couldnt ask for anything more from the display (other than color eInk but it doesnt seem like well be getting that anytime soon). Reading on it is delightful, day or night.BatteryThe Kindle Oasis is claimed to have weeks worth of power from a single charge and although I havent been able to test this since I just got the unit I have no reason to doubt this claim based on past Kindles. The display technology is very power efficient and its this battery longevity long with the superior display that really make the Kindle Oasis a great alternative to reading books on your phone or tablet.The unit charges through a standard micro-USB connection so if you already have cables and chargers for micro-USB you can use them with your Kindle Oasis as well.WeightDespite having a gorgeous metal back the Kindle Oasis still manages to feel light in the hand. Holding it for reading is no problem. Holding it with one hand may get a little tiresome after awhile but you can comfortably hold it with two hands with hardly any effort at all.WaterproofingOf course one of the big new features with the Kindle Oasis is its waterproofing. I havent tried this and hope not to, but its nice to know that it should survive an accidental dip in the pool or splash from the ocean when youre reading on vacation. One of the few actual printed instructions that comes in the box is a note explaining how to drain the unit if you get it wet and how to wash it out with clean water if you happen to get it in salt water or some other potentially damaging liquid. The note stresses that just because its waterproof doesnt mean that you should use it underwater, so any dreams  of reading while snorkeling are going to have to remain dreams for now.SummaryThis is a premium device and it shows. If you are looking for a Kindle and can afford the extra cost for this one then dont hesitate. Theres no better way to read eBooks. Amazon has taken all my wishlist items such as premium materials, touchscreen while still having physical page turn buttons, high resolution display in a great size and aspect ratio, very even and controllable lighting, waterproofing, and good overall design, and cranked out their best product ever.Verdict: Buy it now!UPDATE 11/8/17: After reading with the Kindle Oasis for a week the bright spot in the lower right corner is really bugging me. It seems to persist regardless of which level of lighting I select. It's noticeably brighter in a circular area and then the light seems to fall off gradually to match the rest of the screen. Because of this I'm considering returning the unit and just getting a Voyage or Paperwhite. Stay tuned.UPDATE 11/10/17: The bright spot on the screen really bothered me, especially with this being a premium device. If it wasn't so expensive I could excuse the bright spot, but at this price level I really expect it to be flawless. I could attempt to exchange for a different unit but my experience in the past is that the replacement unit may have even more screen flaws and Amazon will not continually replace the device when the issues fall within what they consider acceptable (I may just be super sensitive - most people may not even notice a difference). I have instead opted for the Kindle Paperwhite for less than half the price of the Oasis. The Paperwhite definitely has light issues as well, but they are mainly along the bottom of the screen and in specific areas that don't really bother me since they bright spot doesn't overlay the text area. I have also found that the Paperwhite display is actually "whiter" than the Oasis (see attached comparison picture). I had both units set on the same brightness and to me the Paperwhite is a more pleasant shade for reading.Sure, the Paperwhite isn't waterproof, isn't quite as zippy when turning pages (talking milliseconds difference), is a little smaller, doesn't have as much storage (which doesn't really matter unless you need a ton of books available when you are away from wi-fi) ,and weighs a measly 5 grams more, but for my money the Paperwhite is the better device when you factor in the cost. I also like that the Paperwhite has the rubberized back and that the back is the same thickness on both sides. It feels easier to hold.So, while I stand by my original review that the Oasis is the best Kindle yet, the light bright spot coupled with the much higher price lead me to suggest the Paperwhite for most readers.
Great e-reader, but abysmal battery life. I bought mine from another retailer, because Amazon's wait time was too long and I wanted it for a long trip that started the following day.The screen is gorgeous, page turns are fast, lighting is even, the weight and balance are excellent.But all of that doesn't mean much if battery life is just a few (and I mean FEW) hours. I've had a Kindle Paperwhite and a first generation Oasis as well; this new one has the worst battery life by a lot.I have had a Kindle Oasis 2017 (32GB with Cellular) since 3 November. I'm very unimpressed with the battery life. In airplane mode, I think it lasted about 8 hours, brightness no higher than 8 and frequently at 2 or 3. With Cellular on, it was maybe 2-3 hours? I didn't track it, at that time.After the third full charge, I put it on WiFi, and it's had a good signal. I did also make sure it was not stuck indexing. My results from full charge to ! Battery depleted was under four hours. This time I tracked it; see below for brightness levels etc. Next testing will be with in airplane mode, with time and brightness tracked. I got this for travel/long flights, and this is NOT what I expected.Kindle Oasis 2017 battery lifeFull charge.

I am in love with this Kindle!  I am an avid reader that does most of my reading on my Kindle.  I have been using different Kindle devices since 2010 or so.  I have a Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Basic, Paperwhite, Voyage, and a Fire that I use at different times.  Each device has features that I like and over the years, I have had several things that I knew I would like to see in a device.  The first Oasis didn't have any real appeal for me but the moment I saw the specs for this version, I knew that I would have to add it to my collection.There are two features on this Oasis that came straight from my personal wish list.  The first is the larger screen size.  I have probably told my husband at least once per week that I would like a bigger Kindle.  Every single new release has had the same 6" screen with the expection of the DX which has not been made for some time and the Fires which I do like to use for reading.  The 7" screen is wonderful.  It is bigger without being cumbersome to handle.  The actual device is not much larger than my Voyage or Paperwhite.  It is a bit wider but the height is fairly equal.  The difference is that there is less of a frame around the screen.I was also very pleased to find page turn buttons on this device.  My Kindle Keyboard and Kindle Basic had this feature but the more recent trend has been a touchscreen such as with the Paperwhite.  I thought that I would like the page press on the Voyage but I found that it was the same as a physical button.  I have already read a novel on my new Oasis and loved being able to press a button to turn the page.  You can still turn pages with the touchscreen if you prefer but I am happy to have the buttons.  You do have to use the touchscreen for other commands and to access the menu features.I like that this Kindle has an aluminum back.  I think it feels like a much more solid e-reader and it feels nice in my hands.  I have not purchased a case for this device yet and have held it in one hand while reading.  It has felt very comfortable and natural.  I am also intrigued by the ability to invert the black and white on the device so the the print is white on a black background.  I did try this feature out just a bit and am not sure how much I will end up using it.  I am still happy to know that it is an option.I have not used the Audible feature on the device.  I do wish that the device had a headphone jack since I have a pair corded headphones that I love.  I am not going to purchase bluetooth headphones just to listen to my audiobooks on this device.  I listen to a lot of Audible audiobooks and have no issue doing so with my cell phone. I think that the size of this device would make it somewhat awkward to carry around in order to listen to my books.  I will be sticking to my cell phone for audiobooks for right now.  If I change my mind, it is nice to know that the device has the capabilities.I can easily say that the Oasis is my favorite Kindle that I have owned.  I like just about everything about it.  The clear and crisp screen is a very nice size, the page turn buttons are perfectly positioned, and the aluminum backing looks and feels nice. I bought the 32 GB device with cell connectivity and am looking forward to spending many quality reading hours with my new Oasis.
I really wanted to like this one. I really loved the original kindle oasis 1st generation, and thought this would be a great upgrade.The increased screen size is nice, but there was a yellowing & depth issue with the left side of the screen. Instead of the reader being flush and even all of the way across, it seemed like the e-ink would slightly sink into the base on the left side. There was also a slight yellowing on the left side of the display.My device was most likely defective, but the final issue that made me return it was the comfort factor. The  increased weight due to the stainless steel makes it harder to hold for long periods of time. It feels more clumsy than the super light 6 inch oasis. I wish the grip felt as comfortable as last years Oasis, but it just doesn't.If they could make 3rd generation plastic again, decrease the weight, and improve the ergonomics of the grip, I'd be interested.
I'll save the lengthy review, there's enough of them. Instead, offering a kindle pro tip for those that complain of the weight. I went from paperwhite 2016 to this oasis model, and I appreciate the aluminum backing's durability and style so it being a few ounces more is not an issue. PRO TIP: With the latest updates you can now change the orientation of the page, to landscape mode. This allows you to hold the Oasis with the thicker spine being along the bottom offering a nice evenly distributed and comfortable reading position while in bed or awkward angles. I now read like this most of the time. Follow the pictures to see how to get there in the Page settings. Enjoy you bibliophiles you.
This needs clarification, because there is a lot of bad information going out on the issue, so I'm putting it at the top of this review.  The Kindle Oasis DOES have text to speech.  It's now called VoiceView and this is how to get to it:  settings / Accessibility / VoiceView Screen Reader.  It does NOT require an audiobook to use, but it does require Bluetooth headphones.And now back to the review.This review is for those trying to choose between the two more advanced Kindle offerings.I love my Kindle Voyage.  I love it so much I asked for the upgrade for Christmas.  I received it.  I am now the proud owner of a 32g Oasis 2nd Gen, and I love that too, but not as much.  I'm writing this review now, because the flaws in the Oasis 2 have shown me just how perfect the Voyage is as an ereader.They have the same PPI, but I'm pretty sure the Voyage is clearer.  The Voyage definitely has a whiter background.  I set them to the same lighting level of 10 and set them side by side in front of a window.  The Oasis 2 is more yellow.  It took an increase in the light settings of 3 levels to achieve the same look on the Oasis 2.The devices also have practical differences.  The Voyage is symmetrical.  There are page press buttons on both sides, so switching hands while reading one handed is no big deal.  To do the same on the Oasis 2 or Oasis 1 for that matter requires you to flip the device.  No big deal, except that you have to relocate your spot on the page.  I suppose I could just wait to switch hands until I'm done with the page, but the Voyage does not make me strategize in order to read.  The experience with cases is also different.  I have aftermarket cases on both devices.  The case on the Voyage makes it easier to hold.  It's just too thin for my male hands without it, women's experience may vary.  The Oasis 2 however feels twice as heavy once the case is on.  I suspect it has something to do with the odd shape or just how wide it is, so I usually end up transporting it in the case but removing it to read.  Without a case it feels like you're holding perfection though.  I'm awed by how good it feels in my hands.  I never get that feeling from holding the Voyage case on or not.  Without the case the Oasis 2 actually feels lighter than the Voyage, a nice balancing trick that is pretty impressive.  Don't worry about the weight though.  The Voyage is extremely light.So in closing if you are trying to decide between these two devices, the Oasis 2 is only worth the additional cost if1.  You want the 7" screen2.  You want to listen to audiobooks on your ereader3.  You really like physical buttonsIf none of the above apply to you, then you're actually better off getting the Voyage.
Fast page turns. Perfect, larger screen. Super light.  Waterproof. My sole complaint is the meta case is slippery and harder to grasp than the plastic/rubber backed Kindles.  But I found a simple solution. Add a no slip safety square used to prevent slips in the shower. Like this one:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCYSH18/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1  It even has a very similar transparent and gray, as you see in the photo. It allows a great grip and even stays on when it gets wet at  the beach or pool.
Great Expectations Dashed - And Compounded by poor customer service.When we returned to US from International trip we requested help again regarding this "Lemon" of a $350.00 32 G Wifi/Cell. To-day Amazon provided their solution an we received an "All New Oasis" which turned out to be a poorly boxed refurbished unit.A brand new top of the line $350.00 Oasis malfunctions out of the box and Amazon thinks a refurbished unit is a suitable replacement - it is not!!!I have escalated and will update on Amazon's further "customer service".Original Problem - brand new $350.00 Oasis Kindle.4 hours reading on Airplane Mode and the battery is dead.Recharged same again.
First, I am retired and I am catching up on all the reading I did not have time for when I was working. So, I use and love my kindle. Also,this review is intended for those of us who need not have the latest and greatest technical advance but keep our devices for a long time.So, after 7 years of beloved use of my kindle keyboard I decided to upgrade.  I had my eye on the Voyage once the screen problems were corrected.  I considered the first Oasis but it seemed a bit inconvenient with the charging case and overpriced.I read all the reviews (Amazon site and online experts). Decided that a Paperwhite would be fine but what the hell I keep my devices seven years and read whenever I get a chance.I absolutely love it. Now remember much of what I love is available on the Paperwhite and Voyage. But some of what I love is not. The Oasis is remarkably light and easy to read with one hand, especially when sitting.  Forget that slippery, cold, sharp edge stuff you read in a lot of the 158 reviews I read.  I do not find the edges sharp or the device cold and the metal case is definitely more sturdy than the alternative plastic.and the lighting blows me away.For me it is definitely worth the $50 more than the Voyage.  Since I plan on another 7 years before I buy another kindle and how much I read it is worth the $130 difference from the Paperwhite.
I feel disappointed. I have been waiting for the device for so long, but after I received it and turn it on, I already notice the problem at first glance. The display area near the button, the display is whitish and brighter than the opposite area where the screen is dimmer and look more yellowish.
I am writing this review as a long-time Kindle user who, much to my familys dismay, has purchased every version of the Kindle since version one with the exception of the original Kindle Oasis (please, dont judge!).  I bought this one to replace my Paperwhite, which after hauling it around through various airports across the globe and dropped it a few times had become a little sluggish and need of a replacement.  As there are several different versions you can configure for this Kindle, to clarify I purchased the 32 GB version with both cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity.The immediate benefit of this version of the Oasis is the larger screen at seven inches versus the six inch of both the original Oasis and the Paperwhite.  Why does that matter?  You get more words on the screen with the same font  thats great for people like me as my up close eyesight gets worse with each day.  The fonts are much more crisp and readable (for lack of a better word) as there are more pixels per inch than previous version of my Paperwhite.  I also like the fact there are more lights in the backlight display which makes it easier to see when the lighting around you is darker  no, its not like a flashlight but something that really enhances the reader experience as reading on a plane at night this past week was a much better experience not only for me but the people on my row.It is also very lightweight, and holding it without a case seems like a feather even though it has a larger screen  they have really skinnied down the thickness in comparison to other models.  I do prefer a case, as it makes it feel like I am really reading a book and also to protect the Oasis for the inevitable drop, and Amazon has a limited amount of versions.  Unfortunately, the cases that are available right now are not only expensive but they are not functional and slip off easy and really dont protect anything.  In other words, unless you have money to burn, I would see if you can wait on a case until third-party providers start making them available.The processor inside is allegedly faster, but I have no way to measure its efficiency other than the pages turn quicker; you can turn to the next page by tapping the side of the screen or pushing one of the buttons on the side.  Its also a lot faster adding and removing books from different categories as I finish or add new books than previous versions  gone is the 30 second wait of doing that on my Paperwhite (I have about 500 books on my Kindle).I am not much on audiobooks but I realize some people are.  This years version of the Oasis allows you to play audiobooks  there arent speakers or a headphone jack built into it but the Oasis does have Bluetooth capability.  Setting up my basic pair of Bluetooth speakers was easy and the sound quality is good.  I think this is a great addition for the vision impaired or for those who like to listen to audiobooks, but please note it does not appear you can listen to an audio version and read along with the text at the same time.This version is also allegedly waterproof - I did not test it out but will take their word for it.  I wouldn't recommend you test it out by sitting in the bathtub reading: you don't want to be the person where it failed and die from electrocution!As I mentioned above, I bought the 32 Gb version with both the cellular and WiFi connectivity  thats the most expensive version and it cost quite a bit at $349; that is very expensive if you are a casual reader vs. a bookaholic like I am.  I picked the cellular version as I dont have reliable WiFi many times due to my travel areas and I want to be able to receive my blog and newspaper subscriptions when I am on the road; if you have consistent WiFi coverage, I would recommend sticking with the WiFi only version and save a few bucks.  If the price doesnt scare you off of this one and you read a lot, I would recommend this one  on the other hand, if price is a consideration or if you are a casual reader, I would recommend the Paperwhite vs. this one as it is still a very nice e-reader and they have better cover options to protect your Kindle.
I've told my husband for years that if Amazon ever makes a waterproof Kindle I'm throwing my money at them.  The time has arrived!!  I've owned many Kindles and am a big bathtub reader.  I drowned one Kindle and have since been reading them through a plastic bag.  Very underwhelming.  The new Oasis is gorgeous.  I am smitten.  Beautiful, even lighting.  I was quickly won over by the bigger screen.  I skipped the first Oasis so this is my first introduction to the lopsided form factor.  At first I was a bit put off, but now I can honestly say this is the first Kindle I've truly been able to comfortably read one handed.  Love. Love.  Love.
(This review was originally posted on Among The Reads - amongTheReads.net)I do confess to loving technology, and I have owned the Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite, and Kindle Voyage.  But I did have good reasons for each upgrade.  After having my Kindle Voyage since 2014, I woke up one Saturday morning in October to discover it wouldnt turn on.  After a minor panic, I spent time searching the internet for cures and even called Amazon (only to lose the connection due to our terrible cell signal!)  So my husband and I talked about it and decided that it was time to use the points we had been accumulating from our Amazon card and get me a new Kindle.I knew that I needed a Kindle with a built in light at a minimum.  As I looked at the specs of each of the Kindles, I kept coming back to the slightly bigger screen of the Kindle Oasis and the fact it is waterproof (I have been known to read in the bathtub on occasion.  After much deliberation and prayer for wisdom, I decided to order the Oasis and prepared to be Kindle-less until the end of the month.Fortunately, after a day of using my phone to read (yuck!), I did some more searching and found someone who recommended charging the Kindle directly to a wall outlet using a Kindle charger.  I rolled my eyes and decided it was worth trying.  And as strange as it sounds, that actually solved my problem!  My husband graciously agreed to let me still get the new Kindle, on the condition that my old one would go to him.Kindle Oasis vs Kindle VoyageI have now had my Kindle Oasis for almost a week and wanted to share a comparison between the two models and give you my impressions.First off, the Oasis is not cheap.  Starting at $249 for the version with wireless and Special Offers compared to the Voyage which is $199 for the same.  Both are side-lit, both have the option to get the free cellular coverage (for an additional cost, of course).WiFi Only vs Free Cellular CoverageAfter getting the cellular coverage and not paying to remove the Special Offers on my first Kindle, I decided that WiFi works perfectly fine as I am mostly in places that I can get it, and when Im not, I can use my phone as a hot-spot if I really have to download a new book when Im at the airport or grocery store.Special Offers or not?And for me, it is worth it to pay to not have the Special Offers on the screen saver of my Kindle.  At first, the offers were pretty good, but they ended up being for things I never need or care about.  The worst part of the special offers, in my opinion, is that offers show up on the screensaver, and you have no control over the content.  So I might have my Kindle on my desk at work with a picture of the cover of a horror book or a really steamy romance book.  Or diapers.  Sorry.  Just not interested in having to see that!Kindle Oasis vs Kindle Voyage - ReviewThe picture attached has the Kindle Oasis on the left, the Voyage on the right.  As you can see, the screen of the Oasis is considerably larger than the Voyage.  Though I couldnt discern a difference in the clarity of the text, there are more font options and more ways to control the appearance of the screen on the Oasis.You might also notice that the screen of the Voyage has a glare, while the Oasis does not.  The overall color of the screen and the quality of the reading surface of the Oasis was significantly nicer than the Voyage.  The description that keeps coming to mind is that is that the Oasis is softer, but not as in fuzzy text.  It is just gentler on the eyes.Weight/FeelThough the weight of the Oasis is a half ounce more than the Voyage (6.8 vs 6.3 ounces), I seriously found that the Oasis feels lighter.  As I started to write this review, I had it in my head that the half ounce difference was in favor of the Oasis and was an influencing factor.  When I looked up the actual weights, I was surprised.  My thought is that the larger size of the device has the weight distributed differently causing it be better balanced and thus feel lighter.  Or something like that.The Oasis is much thinner than the Voyage, and is designed to be turned over so you can switch hands as you read for comfort.  When I read in my recliner at home, I have my Kindle on a tablet arm, but I do spend quite a bit of time reading in other locations and have found that I really like the ability to flip it over and switch hands when I need to.  Lately Ive found that I like setting the display so I can have the wide part of the device at the bottom to hold it from there.The buttons for turning the pages are placed in a good spot.  I have the option with the Oasis to either use the buttons or simply touch the screen to navigate.  I find I use both options, probably because Im not used to using the buttons on the Voyage.Power ButtonThe one thing I dont like is the placement of the power button.  It is at the bottom of the Kindle (if you are holding it with the buttons on the left) and close to the edge.  Normally it isnt a bad thing, but I keep thinking that when I have it in the tablet arm that the mechanism that holds the Kindle will press on the button and turn it off.  So far, Ive been able to place it so that doesnt happen.  However, I have to confess that I have been known to read while I brush my teeth, placing my Kindle between the sink and the mirror.  In the week Ive had the Kindle, it has turned off in the middle of my brushing.  As soon as I see it happening, I realize that I once again placed it with the power button against the counter, and the weight of the device causes it to sink into the button and thus turn it off.  How embarrassing!CapacityWhile I dont tend to read multiple books at the same time, I do get lazy about removing them from my Kindle.  And when I get a new book from Amazon, it is sent to the Kindle by default.  As the device fills up, it slows down, which is annoying.  The storage on the Voyage is 4 GB, which sounds like a lot, but I have managed to get to the slow-down point on it quite easily.  The Oasis starts at 8 GB and if you want, you can get it with up to 32 GB of storage.  I dont plan on using it for Audible, so I should have lots of room for my e-books on it.Overall ImpressionOverall, I have to say Im delighted with the Oasis.  It is hard to say if I would have paid this much for the upgrade if I didnt have the points available because it wasnt an option for us at this time, but I really, really like my new Oasis.  And the way I see it, what I paid for it is less than a few nice-looking bookshelves and much harder to make look messy or cluttered.
So I really want to love this guy. The form factor is nice. The leather case I got is great. The ink looks amazing. The lighting is even. I like having physical buttons. I like that the screen flips when I rotate it. And, well, I can read books on it!Also, the origami case thing is great. I do like the Foley thing.The bad:Its not that easy to hold one handed. Its a little slippery, a little to heavy, and awkward to change pages.But now the real problem. And amazon please chime in here if I have a dud or something: battery life. My old paper white got like 20x the battery length, with WiFi on, compared to the oasis 2 with WiFi off. Not sure if mine is defective? But I was at 50% after reading for maybe 4 hours. So? Not good.My conclusion is that a kindle paper white is still the best kindle. Its way cheaper and does everything this one does, except have physical buttons. And I dont care about listening to audible books on my e reader. I have a smartphone. Everyone has a smartphone. Most importantly, I want a kindle that I dont have to plug in every night!
Love:larger screen sizeslight sepia tone of screen (vs. super white light screen of original Oasis)more font sizesability to darken fonts for better contrastoption for large page number and percentage read in bottom cornersHate:super slippery cold aluminum backsharp edges where metal meets glasspointy corners that poke into my palm when holdingthe clicking sound when you change pages (definitely louder than original Oasis)cover (comes separately) bad, bad designAudible books option-- completely unnecessary bloat in my opinion--especially since-you can't read and listen at the same time-there is no headphone jack--Bluetooth only. I rarely listen to Audible, but when I do, I can use my phone, Alexa or other devices.I feel like I have to compromise comfort for features. Jury is still out on whether or not I will keep it.UPDATE Nov 30--As seen in comments below, the Popsockets saved my Oasis. I also added Everbilt 2-inch anti-slip pads on the back to cover the cold slippery aluminum. The pads make it comfortable and give a secure grip. It doesn't look so great, but since I can't see the back while reading, it doesn't matter. It is too bad that I had to add these modifications to make it work, but I now truly enjoy reading on my new Oasis.
UPDATE. i just read a 300 page book and had to recharge FOUR times. I've been on the phone with customer service for over an hour. DOWNGRADE TO A ONE STAR. BATTERY LIFE IS NOT GOOD. IT DRAINS WAY TOO FAST. BYE BYE OASIS .this is my 4th or 5th kindle.PROS.crisp clear ink.love the adjustable bold settingslove the adaptive lighting. love the easy highlighting.love the buttons with all my heart.love the amigurami cover for standing the oasis uplove the magnetic on and off with the coverlove that amazon logo is not in the center of the coverlove that it works with audibleCONS. the aluminum body is COLD. Even with the case....this is a cold ereader and i don't like that at all. In fact I hate it.  The aluminum body is SLICK and slippery.  Its also a lot heavier than the original oasis. This is like a brick compared to the first oasis.Didn't realize i wanted immersive reading until i read other reviewsSUMMARY...I know nothing is perfect....but this  new oasis is close. So, I love it but HATE the aluminum body which adds weight  and  coldness.
I pre-ordered this Kindle so I've been reading on it for just about a week.  Not going to do a detailed review as there are some already here.  This is my fifth Kindle.....have had all except for Voyage....and have been reading on the first Oasis since it came out in Spring of last year.  I usually read for hours every day so the battery never lasts very long but I will say this battery charges very very quickly so it isn't a big deal.  I would estimate that I can read for about 4-5 days on a full battery....that is many many hours of reading considering I read anywhere from 4 - 9 hours daily.  This Kindle has a very solid feel to it but I agree with others that it is slippery and with my arthritis I first wondered whether I would be able to find a way to hold it, but I have and it's even comfortable. You always have the option of buying the cover. For me, the page turn buttons are in a perfect location but it really just depends on the size of your hand and how you hold it.  And you do notice how much more you read on a page with this bigger screen plus the page turns are so quick you don't even notice so it really is a continuous reading experience.  Now, for the reason I pre-ordered this expensive Kindle when I already had the original Oasis.....for me it's all about the new option to invert the black and white (found at Settings, Accessibility).....the page becomes black and the text is white and it removes all the brightness, the glare and eye strain that were problematic to me with all previous Kindles.  It is a total game changer for me and I just can't overstate what a difference it makes.  And for that reason alone it was completely worth it for me to buy this Kindle.  It is expensive and only you can decide if it's worth the expense.  It is anawesome reading experience!
So far, a tale of two Kindle experiences.The first tale is the screen. The visual experience is marvelous. Best screen of the many Kindle models Ive owned.Second tale is the ergonomics. Its a sad tale. The slippery aluminum back requires a tight grip. Oh wait, whats that cutting feeling...? Why, its the sharp edge of the aluminum back digging into the skin of your hand. Thinking of reading in bed and balancing the Kindle Oasis on your sheets? Its not happening friend because the smooth aluminum back isnt staying put.Thus, I cant see keeping the Kindle Oasis. I will likely return it and go back to the Paperwhite with its inferior screen.... but at least my hand wont cramp up while trying to hold it.
What others have stated. Blurry screen and really poor battery life. Charge to 100% read for an hour then it's down to around 75%. Wth is that? My phone is better than that.Really confused as to why the battery is so poor. I have Bluetooth always off and even put it on airplane mode with no wifi and still have bad results.
Many articles can tell you the different specifications between the old and new Kindle Oasis.  I am giving my opinion as to how I use the device.  I would have given the product a 4.5 stars with weight and slickness of the aluminum back, however, since I can only choose 4 or 5, its strengths outweigh the weakness.I bought my first Kindle OASIS with 3G the first quarter of 2017.  When I heard that Amazon was coming out with a new version, I preordered it.  I was excited about the increase in memory, the larger screen size, and the water proofing.  When it arrived, I noticed it was really heavy compared to the older Oasis.  It was so much heavier that it surprised me.  The aluminum backing is really slick and within just a few minutes of holding it, it slipped right out of my hands and fell on a chair cushion.  I thought, note to self, be more careful.  This is not a huge issue, but I have to remind myself to be careful or I may drop it again.The screen on the new Oasis is really nice.  It is hard to believe that one inch can make a difference, however, reading a very large novel it makes a noticeable difference.  Last night I realized the larger amount of text that fits on the page with the settings I use.  So my finger hits the button to advance the page lessLOL!  Ok, that really does not matter, but it was just a nice feature that I did not think would make a difference at all, but I like it.  I also really like the auto light adjust.  I dont really set the brightness myself anymore.  When I sit back and turn on the Kindle Oasis, I see the brightness adjust and I just start reading.  Adding the auto brightness control was a nice touch.The new Oasis is supposed to have a new processor.  I tried to notice if there was a speed increase with turning pages.  There may be but it seems to be only a slight increase.  I am reading the Wheels of Time series and everything works as I would expect it too.  I think it is cool that any book with an audio book attached shows up as a headphone icon in the library.  (I have not use the audio book feature yet.)  The rapid charge capability is really a great touch.  I use a rapid charge on my watch and phone.  It is nice to have one on my Kindle too since I keep it near me when possible.I bought a leather and waterproof cover.  I like the waterproof cover better because the weave has a texture to it that can help me hold the Kindle without the fear it will slip out of my hands again.  While the new Kindle is better in almost every way, there is one area where I still prefer the old kindle.The older Oasis is really light weight.  There are times I really like that.  The older Oasis had a rubber section on the grip so I was less likely to let it slide away from me.  It may not be as durable as the new Oasis, but when I am just reading in a chair, it is really nice.  Outside of this, I prefer the newer Kindle in every other way.Should anyone upgrade?  That is a personal choice.  I love to read my Kindle Oasis (2016 & 2017).  My Kindles are my favorite device and that is saying a lot!  The new version has wonderful features and more memory, however the older version is noticeably lighter and really a winner as well.  To me, it was worth the upgrade.  Hope this helps.
I've just received this Oasis on Nov 1 as a special birthday gift for my fianc. I'm so glad to see him really loves it. I have my kindle Paperwhite, so I can compare my Paperwhite to his Oasis. I can only say that the Oasis can beat the Paperwhite in overall except its high price. The good things of the Oasis are its light weight, the bigger screen size, the faster page turning and the elegant appearance. That's all I feel that It's worth the money!!(In the picture, I set both kindles in the same modes, i.e, font size: 5 and light: 8. The oasis does a better job as it can provide more words in one page; However, the Paperwhite is still the best budget)
Ergonomically unfriendly - difficult to hold in one hand or pick up with one hand.  The battery only lasts 2 days at most (with Wifi off).  Depending on how you hold it (not touching the buttons) it will index several pages on its own.  This is my 4th kindle and the worst by far.  I find myself using the kindle paperwhite (with damaged pixels) rather than the Oasis E-reader 7" (2017).  Very disappointed.
I'm coming from a first generation paperwhite and this is a huge upgrade for me. I've been looking at the voyage and the previous gen oasis as upgrade options but there was never really a standout feature that could get me to bite the bullet. The waterproof feature is what makes all the difference for me. Being able to finally read in the tub or pool is great.The construction feels great. It's lighter than my paperwhite but what  I really notice is how well balanced it is. I can easily support it with a few fingers and this makes it ideal for reading while lying down. The screen is fantastic and displays much better contrast and clarity at the same brightness levels as my paperwhite. I have no use for the Audible feature but the construction, screen quality, and waterproofness are enough for me to justify the significant cost.Looking at other reviews, I have to wonder if there aren't severe quality control issues going on. Some have had issue with sharpness of the edges. On mine, they are perfectly well rounded and I can't feel any edge at all. I've seen other reviews mention issues with contrast or yellowing of the page due to the backlight. Again, on my device these aren't apparent in the slightest. Looking at a video review from a  customer that had these issues, it's almost like we bought different models altogether. I highly suggest that anyone experiencing these issues exchange theirs for another device before settling or returning completely.
I really like the size and everything of the tablet.  The text looks great and the lights are very clear.  My biggest complaint is that it's not very comfortable at all to hold while you're lying in bed.  The little indention works great when you're sitting down or standing up, but lying in bed, it puts a lot of pressure on your thumb and fingers and I'm constantly having to readjust it which I've never had a problem with on my old e-readers.One thing I did that's helped a lot is I got a "popsocket" like people use for their cellphones for it and it helps reading in bed a lot.  I see that they also sell some straps that would probably work also.  You definitely need something for it if you usually read in bed.
When I first started using the new Oasis I had some qualms and thought I would return it.  I've had a 1st gen Kindle Paperwhite for the past five years and I was looking to upgrade to something faster (the Paperwhite is slow as molasses), with better lighting, and a better display (honestly, I was hoping that a 4th gen Paperwhite was going to be released this year).  Despite the price, I decided to take the plunge on the new Oasis.First off, the build quality is great; there is no question that this is a premium device.  Navigating through the menus and screens is super snappy.  Having more screen real-estate is great, especially with how much sharper it is than the screen on my aging Paperwhite.  The LEDs illuminate the screen with perfect evenness.  The buttons have a great tactile feel and and super clicky.  The touch screen is super responsive... and I mean SUPER responsive.  This is an unexpected improvement over my Paperwhite (even if it does mean that I sometimes accidentally turn the page when I absentmindedly let my thumb wander).  The new Oasis is also considerably lighter in the hand than my Paperwhite.However, once I started using the device I had a few reservations which I've slowly been getting used to.-The ergonomics are very different than the Paperwhite I've grown so used to.  Finding that "sweet spot" in my grip while holding the Oasis took some experimentation, and it is becoming more comfortable.-There is a lot of lag when waking the Oasis from a sleep state.  On my Paperwhite I open the cover and the screen instantly pops to life.  The Oasis... not so much.  Whenever I open the cover or press the power button I am greeted with a "Waking Up" message and it takes a few seconds for the home screen or the book I'm reading to load.  I am hoping that this will be addressed in a future firmware update.-The screen takes some getting used to.  With the high resolution everything is super sharp, but the perceived contrast is not as good as the Paperwhite.  I'm finding this to be a result of the fact that, due to the high resolution of the Oasis, the font weight is lighter.  I have to boost the boldness of the text, but once I do the contrast issue is no more.  Once you're in a book, the page layout (margins, line spacing) are very different than I'm used to on the Paperwhite (even with the same settings selected).  It took some playing around to find a setting on the Oasis that suited the screen and how I am comfortable reading.-I was really excited by the idea of auto brightness, but in practice I found it to be really distracting.  Even with the slightest change in my position or the clouds moving in front of the sun coming through my window, the front light would very noticeably change, interrupting my reading.  I'm finding that manually setting the brightness between 10 and 13 suits my needs in any ambient lighting condition.All in all, I'm really liking this device.  The next feature I'd love to see in future iterations is warmer LEDs to be used in the front light.  Why, Amazon, do you insist on using the same cool blue-white LEDs that are found in the first Paperwhite from five years ago?  I'd much rather see a neutral or soft white.
UPDATE since November purchase 1. Clearly, Amazon's Kindle Product Management Team did not conduct anthropological and UX consumer field tests in northern states. The coldness of the unit maks  holding it painful to the point of needing a barrier between fingers and metal surface, and the totally smooth back, combined with unit weight means unusual finger pressure must be applied to hold it without dropping or sliding which leads to hand and finger muscular fatigue. A simple fix of a thin silicon skin would have aliviated this issue.2. Battery life is shorter than Voyage or Original Oasis.Significantly short.3. Pages skip rapidly and at random when Oasis 2 is  held in one hand with thumb initating page turns - in all books purchased.4. I have experienced three total freezes where the Oasis 2 can't be turned off and must wait until unit self-rebootsMy initial review is below. Most appauling Us Amazon's Kindle Team's lack of response and marketing department arrogance in not addressing these issues. As a long time Amazon (and Kindle) customer, i expect more of a company that enjoys such consumer loyalty  I love it, really enjoy the reading experience (screen crispness, illiumination,) overrides the flaws that are serious enough that unless you are a voracious e-book reader or high-loyalty Kindle customer, you might want to consider the smaller 6" Oasis with integrated cover or the narrower/heavier Voyager.1) the Kindle Product Group should consider offering a one or two finger back-of-Oasis2017 accessory that makes it easier to hold the Kindle with one hand. Too much one hand pressure is needed to hold the Kindle comfortably.2) the touch screen is too sensitive at the left edge causing multiple page advances if just a small portion of one's thumb brushes the screen.3) the "clicks" when using the hard buttons emit a far-too-loud sound that in the quiet of a bedroom is loud enough to interfere with the sleep of a partner.4) Kindle/Amazon should be mature and self-assured enough not to over-promise on battery life. Real-time usage gives the battery only a day or so before recharging is necessary. To advertise weeks is just purly misleading, and  beneath what I believe Jeff Bezos has in mind as to what Amazon stands for. It's unconscionable.5. It seems that arrogance has taken over the Kindle group, and consumer real-use research has been thrown to the side to just rely on the opinions of Amazon product managers or hired anthropological researchers  that do not conduct pre-release research in "living lab" ICT usage studies with both light and heavy users of Amazon Kindles. If they did, the buttons would be silent, the accessory offerings would include finger holders for back-of-Kindle one-hand support, and a less slippery back panel so hand grips that would need less muscular pressure would be part of the launch product design. The almost complete absence of Kindle Customer Service managers' responses to questions or comments about the new Kindle or the problems with the new covers support this thesis.6. Having my previous WiFi with 3G Kindles all having "offerings" on sleep and wake up screens, I am offended that I could not get that for the slightly lower pricing on the 32Gig 3G, WiFi Oasis2017.I am not disgruntled, rather I am a loyal heavy Kindle user who owns this new Kindle w WiFi & 3G, the 6" Oasis, and the Voyager -- all the older Kindles with 3G offerings and have owned all previous Kindles to the Voyager. I am still happy with the new Oasis, but feel disappointed that Amazon could not have done better with a bit more consumer hands-on research and conversations with existing users.
I have had several Kindles, Kindle Keyboard, Touch, Paperwhite, and Voyager.  I'm just not in love with this kindle enough to justify the price, that it weighs more, or that it just doesn't feel great to hold.  If you are looking to buy an e-reader and don't already have one, this is a good reader but I just don't think it offers enough over the voyager.I read all the time and always have a 'purse kindle' with me so I do use my voyager all the time.  I know a lot of people don't always tote theirs around everywhere but it's just something to keep in mind when you read my review.Better battery life:  The Oasis seems to drop battery pretty quickly but it shouldn't be according to the info on Amazon's website.don't know that it should be.  The battery adds weight and for me, it's easier to charge that to have the weight.  It's not like we're talking bout the other kindles needing to be charged that often (maybe every other week for my voyager).  With the Oasis I feel like I'm dragging around all of this weight for no gain since the battery life isn't great.Waterproof:  I read in the tub an in my pool frequently but I have never dropped a kindle in the water.  That being said, I do use a fancy waterproof case (ok, maybe it's a ziplock) just to be on the safe side (I have dropped paperbacks in the tub before and yeah, not a good time).  I can absolutely imagine someone dropping it in water but I can't imagine it really being submersed but this is a great feature of the Oasis.Bigger screen:  I do really like the new screen but I don't think the extra weight is worth it.  I do like the inverse text color where you can set it to a black background.  I noticed this was for when you are reading in low light but I noticed the screen changed back for a second when I switch pages which is then REALLY bright when you're used to the black background.Audible integration:  it was lame when they took this feature away way back when (I think the kindle keyboard was the last one to have a speaker?) but now, I have Audible on my phone and why do I want to store books here when I still have to connect to a Bluetooth speaker.  I think they added this because of complaints about the change a while ago but took too long to add it back when it's not really needed anymore but others may find this useful.**The cases:  I'm not rating the kindle on the case since it's separate but I will comment on it here since they are both from Amazon.  I have a cheapo case for my voyager that is a stand, has a hand strap and it is sturdy.  I'm not sure why Amazon can't make a multifunctional case.  The current offering has a weak magnet and a crappy stand that only works when you hold the kindle in one direction when you ae supposed to be able to switch hands seamlessly.
Update 11/18/17 - I sent the Oasis back and bought a new Voyage. The battery life was the killer for me. It was fully charged at 3:30 pm last Sunday I read for about 2 hours and it was at 68%. I started reading around 8:00 pm Monday night at 68%, I read for about 3 hours Monday night and had to charge overnight Monday again.  However I do miss the 7 inch screen the new gen 9 Oasis has.I loved the new Oasis at first.  I found it a tad awkward to hold but quickly got used to it. I love the fact its waterproof because a relaxing bath while reading is one of my favorite things. The bigger screen is nice also.  I also like that you can reverse the white screen to black so its easier on the eyes when reading in bed. What I am extremely disappointed in is the battery life. I could go for 7-10 days between charges on my Voyage. Ive had my Oasis for 13 days and have just recharged it for the 4th time! Im currently trying to decide if I want to return it and go back to the Voyage.I say go with the Voyage, unless you want the Oasis  mainly for the waterproof factor or bigger screen.
My advice to Amazon:1) Lose any sharp edges.  This includes the 4 corners firstly and also the edge of the screen.2) Move the next page button higher to a natural place where the thumb would be.  Could move both buttons further apart achieve this.  Also the buttons should be moved slightly left so that they are not all the way to the edge of the device.3) Trade in the cold aluminum for a warmer grippy material.4) Not sure if this is software or hardware but the background sometimes flickers from.white to black or vice versa when next paging or moving between screens.  I don't want the flickering to happening at all especially when I'm reading late at night but really don't want it ever so please fix this.  Seems like a pretty major thing to be happening and i can't imagine it was not known about prior to realease.  Please fix this!4) Make a good cover for the deviceDo this and you would have a great kindle.
I am a little surprised how quickly I have gotten used to the larger page. the six inch paradigm now feels a little too small. That is worth the price of admission! Yes, the e-reader is pricey, but I use my kindle every single day -- at least at night when work kids and all other obligations are through. We unplugged from television years ago.  I don't need to update my ipad. I love my Kindle, I have owned every eink version made and each iteration I have loved a little more. If you love to read, you understand that. If you just want an occasional e-reader, grab a kindle paper-white. It is a terrific e-reader and an amazing value. This device is aimed at us kindle-a-holics. Any downsides? The magnets holding the cover to this one are a little less strong. Not a huge issue, but the other felt more secure when I put it away. The added little bit of weight has led me to taking off the cover to read.Why get it? The screen, it is big without being silly big,  crisp and  the lighting is even. I don't worry too much about the kindle being water proof, but I suppose around vacation time that will be a nice to have. I got this one for two reasons. My younger son wanted my first oasis and I liked the bigger screen.I would have ordered this in any event just to try it, but I knew when I started reading, I was going to keep it.I also like the leather -- more like suede -- cover. I was a little tired of the merlot from my last Kindle so I went for the "tan" (what an awful way to describe what turns out to be a lovely rich brown on the lighter side). I got the leather, because it was actually a little cheaper if you went for the "bundle" with power brick. The standing feature works well and I really prefer it to the "origami" cover that came with the voyage because it opens like a book and isn't floppy.
I really wanted to love this, but it's just not worth it.I like reading while laying down, and I usually hold my Paperwhite with one hand. The only problem was changing pages with one hand. I really thought this would help more than it did. Strangely enough, I don't really find it any easier to hold, and I actually think holding my Paperwhite is easier believe it or not.The aluminum is cold and it can be slippery. My Paperwhite is sturdy and I feel like I'd break the Oasis more easily. I wouldn't want to just toss it in my backpack like I do my Paperwhite.The screen is nice and I like the resolution and lighting. The lack of bezel is nice and make changing pages with a swipe of your thumb really easy. The buttons are okay too. Page transitions happen faster than my Paperwhite. Changing hands is clumsy and I usually end up accidentally changing the page.What it made me realize is that I probably want to try a Voyage instead.
Holding the Kindle randomly changes pages.  Why is the plastic on the edge of the screen sensitive to touch?  With the page turning buttons  Amazon should allow you to disable the touch screen page turning.  Would be 5 stars if they fixed this glaring flaw.
This review is for the All-New Kindle Oasis E-reader - 7" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Waterproof, Built-In Audible, 8 GB, Wi-Fi - Includes Special OffersMy only complaint is that there is still a lag when you click on anything. Amazon needs to up the processor more.I had the original Oasis and I found it to be a tad small. Not much better size wise than reading on your big phone.I also have had two paper whites and tried to get a voyage with a good screen (tried 4), but gave up as they all had yellowish tint and shadows.As you can see getting a good e reader screen is hit or miss with the kindles.The new Oasis that I received has a good one with little discoloration. I have a photographers eye so not much will get past me. There is some, but not much.I like the size. More like the size of a real paperback book. If you like the size of your current kindle, don't get this one. Its as simple as that.It is not as pocketable and portable feeling as the first Oasis or Voyage / Paperwhite.They did kick up the quality of the body with the metal and all. It feels more Apple quality like. If you don't like Apple feel, then you won't like the new Oasis. If you like the rubber feel of the current Kindle, stay where you are at. The screen is bigger and waterproof, with the added audile bluetooth capacity.So far I am enjoying it. I did not get a case for it, as I am just going to tuck it in an iPad sleeve when I go out, or have a dedicated pocket in my messenger bag so other stuff doesn't grind into it. Battery life is good. I have been reading for several days and have not charged it yet since the unboxing.
Do not listen to the negative reviews on this product.  It's not cold.  The only way this could be cold is if you left it in the freezer for a bit.  The edges aren't sharp, as you can see from the pictures.  It isn't even remotely heavy.  These people have got to be minions of a competitor coming on here to bash a superior product.  This is the first Amazon product that when I picked it up for the first time I said "wow".  With your fingers at the edge of the chunky area and your thumb at the page turn buttons, you can hold this for hours with no problem. Turning pages and browsing the store are extremely faster than when using a Paperwhite. The only thing I can complain about is that the battery does not last "weeks".  More like a single week, if that.  Pretty sure that letting it charge for a couple of hours a week isn't that big of a deal, but I do wish they would change their marketing as it is incorrect.I adore my Paperwhite, but if you have the extra cash to snag this then do not hesitate.
I've owned a number of Kindles in the past, and chose to upgrade my 2 year old Voyage for this model.  I also purchased the leather cover.  Out of the box, I was pleased with the balance, feel, and look of the new model Oasis.  It feels good in-hand, and was easy to grip.  I didn't notice the sharp edges others have mentioned.  What I did notice was a lack of contrast and clarity in the display.  Compared to the Voyage, the text just doesn't pop nearly as much.  The background is quite a bit darker with the backlights on both units off, and it has a slight yellowish tinge.  As you increase the brightness, the Oasis is consistently darker for each setting, and the text muddier.  It's hard to believe that both have a 300ppi screen.  The backlight on the new Oasis is very consistent at least, no shadows or bright spots were apparent.  It does have a slightly more bluish tint compared to the Voyage.  Another display issue is the auto-backlight.  It tends to lag quite a bit more than the one on my voyage, and seems to overshoot as well (Shoots the brightness up several notches and then brings it down one).  Not a huge issue, but it is annoying when you change your position relative to the light source and the brightness changes multiple times. One other minor quibble is that the leather cover tends to slide around quite a bit, it's held on magnetically but there is nothing to keep it from creeping around a bit as you adjust your grip.  They should put molded corners on it or something to help stabilize it against the back of the Oasis.If however, this is your first Kindle, or if you are upgrading from an older model, this is a great pick, especially if you desire the waterproofing and bluetooth functions.  If you have a Voyage or one of the new Paperwhites, prepare to be disappointed with the screen.  The extra size just isn't worth the loss of clarity in my opinion.
Finally, a worthy upgrade to my Kindle Voyage. I purchased every iteration of the Kindle line except for the last version of the Oasis. In my opinion the price was too high and it removed some features that were on my Voyage, like the adaptive light sensors. In comes the all new Oasis to save the day and quench my thirst for a new Kindle!I do %95 of my reading in my house, the other %5 in my backyard in the summer. In my case bigger is always better as long as the weight remains minimal, so the extra 1" of screen space is always welcome. Having %30 more words on the screen also means less page presses which in turn enhances battery life.I had hundreds of books on my Voyage and never filled up the memory but the upgrade from 4GB to 8/32GB on the new Oasis is really important. Why? Because it FINALLY supports Audible audio books! They take up much more space than a standard mobi book and I plan on stuffing mine with audio books haha! I absolutely love that I can sync up a pair of Bluetooth headphones and have a random person read me a bedtime story! :DThe other awesome upgrade is that the Oasis is now waterproof! Well, water resistant. It can go 6 feet under fresh water for an hour. I don't plan on reading on the bottom of my pool but it's nice to know it can get submerged and still be good to go. I'm just glad that some rain or splashes of water wont ruin it.While I had no complaints with my Voyage concerning the speed of page turns, the Oasis is noticeably faster. I'm also really happy to have physical page turn buttons again! The Voyage page press worked well I just always missed having a real button.If I had to be nit picky I would've rather had the layout of the device like the Voyage where there were page turn buttons on each side of the screen. The way it is now it gives your hand more real estate to hold the device but if you want to switch hands you have the turn the screen upside down, which will then flip the text right side up automatically. Maybe I'll get used to it over time but right now I prefer the original layout. The only other negative is the offerings for covers are slim right now and both options have lots of complaints. The covers dont stant upright well and the fitting is off. I'm desperately awaiting some 3rd party options.Other than that I love the new Oasis! The price is right, it's feature packed, and offers a ton of new enhancements. Don't forget to turn your WiFi or 4G on as soon as you get your device and apply the OTA updates!Edit: After using my Kindle for awhile there are a few annoyances and things I'd like to see improved in the next version. Most importantly to me is that this Kindle seems to be designed for 1 handed reading. I only read in bed and I'm so used to holding my Kindle with both hands. Unfortunately one side of the Kindle is so thin that I find holding it awkward. There's really no place to put my thumb without it touching the screen and unintentionally turning the page.Battery life doesn't seem to be much better over my Voyage. In fact it seems to be worse even when I turn off Bluetooth and WiFi.Some things I'd love to see in the next version is the ability to display colors. This makes book covers, magazines, comics, etc. look so much better. Also, while I'm happy to have my physical buttons back I wish there was a way to reverse them. The next page button is located on top and is hard to reach the way I hold my Kindle. I'd also like to see the inclusion of a small mono speaker for Audible books instead of having to use Bluetooth headphones. And finally, I'd love to have a choice in screen size. Since I read at home bigger screens are always welcome, although I know some people prefer the smaller size to carry outside the home.My main disappointment is it just seems awkward to hold for the way I read in bed. For that reason alone I'm debating whether to just stick with my Voyage. The only thing keeping me from not wanting to return it is the larger screen size.
Long ago I decided not to buy another Kindle eReader until it could handle Audible books, as now I use Audible far more than either ebooks or paper books.  It has taken Amazon a remarkably long time to produce an Audible friendly eReader!  I find this surprising as Amazon owns Audible and actively promotes using the book with Audible without being able to provide an eReader to do it.  I have been forced to use my Kindle Fire, which is hard on the eyes for extended reading.  The new Oasis is ultralight and easy to hold.  It does not fatigue my hand as heavier ones do. However, it is so light and has such a smooth surface that it also slips out of my hand too easily!  I long for a silicone case to protect it but none currently exist for the Oasis.  I do not like the book style covers that fold over the top of the unit and that is currently all that is available.  The waterproof feature is attractive to me but hasn't been tested by me yet and I see that more as backup protection than something I would actively use.  I have mainly used my Oasis for Audible and my remaining comments mainly pertain to that device.  When I ordered the Oasis, I had not realized that you must have a Bluetooth headset or speaker to use it with Audible.  I only have large headsets and speakers that are Bluetooth equipped.  My need is to pop the Oasis in my purse when I am out and about and need to kill time.  That requires a small light headset, which I had to buy.  I am enjoying using the Oasis at home except for two things:  1.  There is no sleep switch provided for Audible listening, which makes it not useful for bedtime listening and I have to use my Fire instead; and,  2. While I do not mind the promotional "front page" of the Oasis, I find it highly irritating to have my searches and browsing through my library when looking for a book to read frequently interrupted by book promotions, usually the same one repeatedly with no good way to make it go away permanently!  I hate that tactic!  To recap:  The all new Oasis is a good new device but very pricey for what you get!Pros:Light weight and easy to holdAudible capableWaterproof to be beach, boat or bath compatibleCons:ExpensivePoor selection of cases currently availableRequires Bluetooth headsets or speakersNo sleep switch for the Audible functionConstant and repetitive promotional interruptions when browsing my libraryIn short, I like my new Oasis but would probably not have bought it for the price I paid if aware of the drawbacks.  It need's a significant price reduction or improvement in features to be good value for the money!
EDIT, November 8th. I'm going back to the old Oasis. I just can't get past how uncomfortable this is to read, hold, and turn the pages on. It's way too heavy, slippery like an eel, unnecessarily sharp, and loud. I am a bit surprised Amazon let this one out of the design stage and I'm personally shocked I am actually giving up on this one. I'll give it to someone I know and stick with the comfortable and smooth Oasis. I changed back to my old one last night and it really made me extremely happy. This is a rare Amazon miss. This one missed badly.[Old Review Below]I've tried every Kindle since 2007 and usually when they upgrade, it's better across the board, culminating in the first Oasis, which was just amazing from top to bottom. But this version needs work.First things first, the screen is incredible, it's sharp and gorgeous and is much easier to read. It's also extremely fast, you turn the page and it's instantaneous. But I give this three stars for two functional reasons.One, the right edge of the Kindle is sharp. It's very sharp, which makes it uncomfortable to touch or hold. It is an edge that literally must be avoided at all costs. It's a huge design flaw and I'm shocked they issued a Kindle with a non rounded edge on the right side, the side you hold.Two, the page turn buttons are useless if you read in bed next to someone. There is an audible click everytime you turn the page. It's unavoidable (you can't even soft click it) and it's annoying for the reader and possibly torture to the person sitting next to you. Thankfully the screen touch page turn is fine, but I really do like using the buttons. This is a really unfortunate choice by Amazon.I'm still going to use this Kindle version ahead of the previous Oasis because the screen is just that good, but hopefully Amazon does something about the sharp edge and the loudness of the button. They are significant issues.
I bought the Voyage and 1st Oasis and returned each of them because the screen lighting was uneven and the Voyage was pink and blue. This 2nd generation of the Oasis has no such problems.I deducted one star because the blacks on the 2nd generation Oasis are not quite as dark as on the Paperwhite (at least my example from 2015). I would like to see the contrast ratio of the e-ink technology and Amazon's implementation of it improving steadily, but it isn't. This is a small difference in contrast, not a distraction in practice, and the other advantages of the 2nd generation Oasis largely compensate for it:1. The Oasis 2 is more readable at a larger range of viewing angles. I had to hold my Paperwhite at one optimal position to get the best readability, but this Oasis 2 has a wider range of angles that look good.2. Physical buttons are a significant improvement. It's far less distracting and much more comfortable than having to reach over to tap the screen for every page turn. I realize something similar was available on the Voyage, but real physical buttons are the only way to go.3. The ability to slightly bold the text is fantastic. It adds just enough readability that the slightly lower contrast is mainly mitigated.4. The screen size is fantastic. It's not jarringly bigger, but it's enough that I can nudge up the font size and not feel like I'm reading a newspaper headline.5. Very important: this Oasis 2 display has finer gradation of grey tones. Images look much richer and three dimensional. Even very small text in images is crisp and clear.6. The auto adjusting backlight works very well. (I know this was available in the Voyage and the first Oasis, so not a unique benefit).7. Operation is faster. Everything in the Oasis 2 feels quick and responsive, not just page turns.8. Even with screen refresh turned off, there aren't any ghost images on the screen. With my Paperwhite I need to fully refresh the screen with each page turn to get a clear rendering, but the Oasis 2 seems not to need it.9. The on button at the top is much much better than the Paperwhite which puts it inconveniently at the bottom.10. It's lighter than the Paperwhite; feels better in the hand; and is reasonable waterproof.11. The screen is not blue! It looks much more like paper due to the slightly warmer (more natural) color of the LED lights. Excellent!If Amazon can improve the contrast ratio of the screen and keep the other benefits it would be a full 5 stars. I haven't yet had a chance to test the day to day battery life. If it needs to be charged more than twice a month, that would be another downside.
I traded my Voyage for the new Oasis. Used the new Oasis for a week or so, I have mixed feelings about it. The screen is wonderful, and evenly lit. The automatic nightlight feature still does not work, the same problem as on the Voyage.The new Oasis is not particularly comfortable to hold. I have noticed the sharp edges. For me, in order to hold the Kindle upright I need to extend my pinky ( either hand) to balance the weight and that bottom edge is sharp-ish.  Leaves an indentation in my skin. I ordered a vinyl skin from decal girl so I will see if that softens the edge... and if it helps the slippery problem. Yes, it IS slippery, I have had the thing flip out of my hand because its not " grippy" , so again, the vinyl skin may help.And yes, the turn page clicks are a little loud, but after I while when reading I dont really notice. But they sound " cheap"  and for an expensive device like this, I would expect a smoother, quieter click. I tried touching the screen but its not as easy for me to tap screen while holding with one hand.I like that it rotates quickly when changing hands.Upon reading this review it seems I do not like this Kindle. I do, but I don't love it. When the next version comes out I may be trading this one for that too. So, I will keep it for now as the screen is really great and fast. EDIT UPDATE 11.24.17 I downloaded an Audible book and am listening now on my bluetooth headphones and it is fantastic! Crystal clear. Another plus, I must say.
I love this reader.  It is the first one that, I find, one cannot find an undeniable flaw--as a reader.  For example, the first Oasis had a screen that was rather small (deniable flaw) and uneven lighting (undeniable flaw).  But Oasis 2 isn't a perfect reader and is worthless as a audiobook device in my opinion.Good:so fast:first device that has no apparent lag whatsoever that I've used...I've had most Kindles.wonderful solid feel:this is the first Kindle to feel like a high end device.lighting is much better:lighting is without flaw that I can detect.  adaptive now, more LEDs with nightlight feature as well.Bad:much heavier:can't integrate the battery, increase the screen size, waterproof and use aluminum and not gain weight.  but...it's heavier.useless as audiobook player:I paid to increase the memory with the intention of using this an as audiobook player.  But there is no reason for anyone to use it as such.  One cannot follow text with audio, audiobook sending can only be initiated from the device (can't send from audible site), does not organize collection of audiobooks and ebooks well and absolutely most importantly--will only load on the LOWEST quality.  Forget it...what true audiobook-file would go for that?  Maybe and hopefully there will be an update to fix this but until/unless this happens...it is what it is.
I absolutely love this reader. However, the battery life is so bad that I am going to need to carry a charger with me everywhere. This thing only lasts about twice as long as my iPad Air running the kindle app. I am considering returning this device and getting a reader with better battery life.Also, for a $350 purchase price Amazon did not even include a charger, just the cable.  No charger, no cover, horrible battery life..... I just dont feel that this device is worth anywhere close to the price I paid.
Compared to the 300ppi Paperwhite, 12 LEDs vs. 4 makes a BIG difference (to me) in the uniformity of the screen. I don't automatically see LEDs along the screen border and the screen seems more uniform. There are also some additional font options that don't seem to be on the Paperwhite (even though it's updated). The screen size makes a difference. It's not "huge" but definitely bigger and for me it's the right size. Some people say it's slippery to hold. I put a Popsocket on the back (on the thicker side) which makes it easy to hold (I use one on my phone too). Some people talked about quality issues. Mine seems to work perfectly. Some have mentioned poor battery life. I haven't noticed that with mine. I've had this for about 3 weeks and read about 30-45 minutes a day. That said, I turn off both WiFi and Bluetooth, so that may be why. I discovered I have to manually turn off bluetooth, even in "airplane mode." Overall, I am very happy with this, and I'm glad Amazon let me buy it over several payments (seems less "painful" to spend $250 on a reader :-).
I've had Amazon Kindles for years and years. I still have my old Kindle Touch 3G. In fact, I actually bought the last generation Oasis just about a year and half ago, and it was a fine fine product. It was a pleasure to hold and small enough to bring everywhere. Initially I wasn't going to move to the Oasis 2017 / 2nd Gen but just couldn't resist the bigger screen and waterproofing, plus I could trade-in my old Oasis for some discount off as well. I've no regrets upgrading from the 6 inch to the 7 inch Oasis.Performance: Fantastic, it is clearly faster than my previous gen Oasis. EVERYTHING runs quicker: the Kindle store, opening books, turning pages, highlighting pages, etc. It even flips pages quicker too. It certainly feels like an upgrade performance-wise. I absolutely love the automatic backlight adjustment which dynamically changes brightness depending on my environment.Size: The extra screen size made a big difference to my reading. I read more on a page and therefore turn less pages. It makes reading even more pleasurable than the already amazing Oasis Gen 1. There is a caveat though: The larger size meant I can't easily put it in my larger pockets, so I have to carry it, plus it definitely feels a little heavier with the cover.Cases / Covers: It's a pity Amazon made a mistake with their original cover design for this. That said, that left the door open for excellent 3rd party covers like theFintie Origami Case for Kindle Oasis (9th Gen, 2017 Release ONLY) - Slim Fit Stand Cover Support [Hands Free] Reading with Auto Wake / Sleep for Amazon All-New 7" Kindle Oasis, Denim Charcoaland theMoKo Case for All-New Kindle Oasis (9th Generation, 2017 Release) - Premium Ultra Lightweight Shell Cover with Auto Wake / Sleep for Amazon Kindle Oasis E-reader Case, Vintage Style, both of which I bought. It's important to note that the Fintie makes the Oasis quite a bit heavier as the case is weightier, however, I bought this so that I can free-stand my Oasis when required. The Moko feels a lot lighter but it's not origami, so I bought it more for "on the go / in-my-hand" reading, and frankly it's the best looking design cover for an e-book I've seen.Battery Life: Ok, I admit I was terribly worried about the battery life seeing many reviewers complaining about the battery life. In reality, I don't exactly read 8 hours a day, so for what I read (usually up to an hour a day), the battery lasts fine by me even if it only lasted a week or two. The good thing is it doesn't take that long to fully charge the Oasis and it can be charged on any standard micro USB cable / charger so it's not a major concern. Because you no longer require the cover for the "other" battery like the previous Oasis, you can walk around with just the bare-naked kindle and it feels really good (see next section).Look and Feel: It actually feels best in the hand without any covers because it's light and big enough to hold in 1 hand. Because of the larger size, it feels a little more like you're holding a book, and it feels good in my hands. I'm a big fan of the very original Oasis "one-sided bump" design as it feels so natural in the hands. And I simply swap hands if I'm tired and the screen automatically flips over for non-interrupted reading.Waterproofing: I haven't tried dunking it in water yet, but to be honest, I've no reason to do so... yet!Yes, granted, the price of the Oasis is high - but then again, isn't the iPhone X priced highly (overpriced, I might add)? The Oasis was made to be a premium product and indeed, it is a premium product. If you read lots and buy lots of books from Amazon, then this is a no-brainer of a purchase. The waterproofing simply means that you now can REALLY bring your Kindle everywhere and the Oasis finally means something. Highly recommended.
I struggled with the decision about buying a new Kindle, my old one is fine.  This is my 7th Kindle and this is by far the best.  I hadn't realized how much I missed the page turn button (which returns on this model).  It is sooo much better than tapping the screen to turn the page (which often turns two pages or has to be hit multiple times to flip the page on older versions)---the real buttons on this Kindle are great---just enough "click" to confirm you're turning the page.  I've not noticed that the screen is any better as far as quality, but, the additional size is very nice.  I would not have thought an extra inch would be a big deal, but, it really does make a difference.  I actually like the "bulge" at the back, makes it easier and more comfortable to hold (but I do use a case with mine).  I also like the new feature where you can turn the page dark with light letters---seems to cause less eye strain when reading in a dark bedroom.  On the next version, I guess my only slight quibble seems to be the resolution of the screen---on certain fonts the letters are not perfectly smooth, which seems odd after all these generations of Kindles that they've not resolved.  The buttons and the extra size make this worth the purchase, I find myself reading more.
So far I've really been enjoying the Oasis... what I am NOT enjoying is the poor battery life!  If you want any time of longevity, you MUST use 'airplane' mode to turn off Wifi.  Last night I went to bed and it had 50% life, today I started reading and within an hour gave me the 'low battery' message... I then noticed that Airplane mode was Off and Wifi was On.  We are in no way getting the battery life that Amazon claims we should be getting, but, it lasts much longer than my iPad Pro and charges faster too, so there is that.I ended up ordering a cover, without the cover it is slippery and COLD... and winter time in the Midwest right now, being -20 outside it's no fun to hold a cold piece of metal too.  I went with the Indigo MoKo case and it works perfectly; at first it felt uncomfortable, but after I started reading I didn't notice it at all.
I have used a Kindle Touch and a first generation Kindle Paperwhite, as well as the Kindle app on a Fire HD8. I know the Fire is not an e-reader, but rather a tablet. I started reading on the Fire out of a need for a larger screen. I am delighted that Amazon finally broke the 6 inch Kindle screen barrier with the 2017 Oasis. I did a side by side comparison of my Paperwhite with the new Oasis and the Oasis was a far superior reading experience.  The Oasis that I received functioned very well through reading, buying and downloading books, using Wi-Fi, using the Bluetooth feature, and navigating and adjusting the settings.The problem was that the screen had defective lighting. It did not matter what the light setting was at, the side of the screen with the page press buttons was bright across the first 25% of the screen, with the screen growing darker and shadowed across the rest of the screen. It was the same lighting problem no matter the orientation of the Kindle or what page was being viewed. This is a complaint that many reviewers have had. This made me not like the device, giving it two stars for this review and I returned it for a refund.I have read other reviewers mention that Amazon was replacing their defective new Oasis with refurbished used devices, so I opted for a return and refund rather that a replacement. Of interesting note as I started the online process of the return I was presented with three choices after describing a defective product: talk to an expert, replacement and refund. Under replacement it states, Well ship you a replacement of the item you ordered. If a new defective Kindle Oasis is being sent back to Amazon, per their own statement they should be replacing it with a new device not a refurbished one.My plan is to monitor the upcoming new Oasis reviews to see how the customer satisfaction is. If I feel  that the quality of Oasis is improving as defects get addressed then I will reorder the device.
There's much to like about the new Kindle Oasis. I love the adjustable and better screen lighting. It's lightweight and easier to hold (if you want to!). Display is clear and easy to read. Text sizes/fonts - great! So, why one star?Two words. Battery Life.I have had owned a Kindle since they came out. One of my favorite things about the Kindles I've owned (3 prior to the Oasis. Original Kindle and two Paperwhites) has been that I only needed to charge them once every 4-6 weeks. I haven't been able to go 7 days before I need to charge the Oasis. I'm charging it today (Wednesday) and I just charged it four days ago. I only read an hour or less per day. This is far less than I am have ever done with any other Kindle.I haven't been able to find any help on this, but, I think that the buyers should beware!
This is my 4th Kindle and definitely is the best one. My previous one was the Voyage. Even without the Finte Slim Case I bought for it, I don't see the problems others have mentioned. The edges aren't sharp, the back isn't slippery, etc. The page-turning options are wonderful. And, after two books, I've only advanced a page accidentally twice. The supposed battery life problem is irrelevant although, if Amazon is making false claims, they should correct them. I always plug the Kindle in when I'm finished reading for the day. Why wouldn't you do that?The big thing here is the screen size and the improved readability of the text. Much appreciated.
I have used or owned kindle ereaders since their inception and this new oasis is by far the best.With the new updated software enabling test size and contrast along with the  extra  light and  inch of screen size ,the new kindle is a splendid reading experience.To those who say it is slippery in the hand due to the aluminum backing, I say  it needs a cover or better yet  a Popsocket placed on the back to fit your grip when reading.The one star reduction on this review is regarding battery life.The charge does not last more than a day or so if you read for hours at a sitting and unless mine is defective.. maybe slightly less.It does however charge full in about 30 minutes.To some this might be unacceptable.My Kindle voyage by comparison lasts a week without a charge(though it does not charge as fast this reader when depleted)..To me however the screen is clear ,well lighted and a pleasure to read on and well worth the cost.(And its waterproof and audible friendly with blutooth earplugs,not included)
I'm been getting a little concerned after reading some of the reviews, and thinking I may have made a mistake sending in my Voyage for the upgrade discount. But my new Oasis arrived and I love it. There are lots of reviews already, so I'll just address some of the negatives mentioned in existing reviews that concerned me. My screen is very evenly lit. The text is as clear and crisp as it was on my Voyage. The sound my page press buttons make was not noticeable until I actively listened for it (and even then only the back made a sound, the forward was silent). The background page color is a little softer, but not as dark as I feared after seeing some comments. I felt it was comfortable to hold and did not feel slippery. (Will use a case anyway) The forward page press button is perfectly placed for my hand, the backward one takes a slight adjustment. I did not have the first Oasis (the only one I think I skipped) but the screen size is nice compared to my Paperwhite and Voyage, but I don't feel it's a dramatic difference. I still have and use a DX and it's still tiny compared to that (I would love to see a reissue of the DX with an upgraded and lit display.) Haven't tried the Audible feature yet. Probably won't. I listen on my phone and no desire to listen while reading. Mine arrived with the battery around 75%. I'll charge it and update the review if I experience the short battery life that several other reviewers have encountered.
Bought my Oasis from a big box retailer due to accumulated coupons. I am coming from years of reading on the Kindle app on iPad, iPhone, and before that, Fire. However before Fire, I had a Barnes & Noble Nook - I loved that thing. Too bad they didn't allow Kindle books on it - e Ink is far superior to just reading on a tablet.Fast forward to this Oasis 2nd gen, 2017 model. I wanted a dedicated reader, something that my kids wouldn't hijack to play other apps; something for me to read my books on, only, with no other distractions. I wanted the "old" e Ink that looks so sharp, so book-like. I also wanted the ability to invert text for bed reading, so as not to disturb my wife so much with the light, as with my iPad reading (even with the text inverted it is bright.) I wanted the anti-glare screen I remembered from my old Nook, and from my wife's standard Kindle.I read probably a hundred reviews, both professional and non-. Watched dozens of videos. I saw how many complained of sharp edges and uneven lighting and non-level screens... to say nothing of complaints of the minimum $250 cost vs the cost of the Paperwhite. After receiving my 8GB WiFi Oasis, I say go for it.This thing is everything I hoped it would be, given that my last dedicated e reader was an early Nook. The construction is top notch. The edges are not rubbery but they are certainly not sharp nor uncomfortable (granted I am an electrical maintenance guy, but I am also a classically trained pianist, and I can tell you that if you can't comfortably hold this thing due to "sharp edges" that you have quite fragile hands indeed.) The "page" surface in white mode is truly beautiful, as is the text. The lighting is really the killer thing about this unit though. Very adjustable, in both automatic and manual modes, but most importantly just so even, so well done that if you weren't looking for it you wouldn't think about it. Really impressive.Weight and balance are really superb. I was most concerned about this prior to getting it, but laying on my back in bed, it is so very light that even though one side is "weighted" with the battery etc. I can easily hold it with one or two hands, the two handed way being what I am used to from using a full size iPad, and the battery side is so light that it feels balanced. It is also easily held with either hand alone; reading and turning pages is pretty effortless between the perfect "buttons" or the touch of the screen to turn the page. You can also set the buttons to work either way (page up or down) and they automatically adjust when you switch hands (i.e. flip the unit.)The screen is no-glare, "textured glass." I can't feel any texture on it but it feels great, and as much as I want to buy a fancy case and screen protector, I know that they would ruin the lightness and perfect non-glare screen, defeating the purpose of owning this thing. I did order a super slim/light case just to offer it some protection from my marauding young children, however I am mainly just going to try and keep it out of their reach until they are a little older and more appreciative.As for the Audible stuff... I really don't use it, I tried Audible and while it was very well done, I found I just prefer to read and don't have enough driving time to make it worthwhile. I understand the Oasis handles it well, but sadly I can't offer any review of that function.If you think you want a top notch e reader for the non-glare, e Ink, non-tablet experience, this is the one to get if you don't mind the cost too much. It is definitely, as others have said, somewhat of an indulgence, but so is reading for pleasure, yes? I am more than happy with my Oasis and I think that if you are still reading this, you will be, too.
I've been through many iterations of Kindle and have been wanting a Kindle Oasis because it's supposed to be so much better than the other models. One of the problems I had with my old Kindle Voyage was that I had to charge the battery every day, so I was disappointed when I received the Oasis and have to charge the battery every day.I thought I had a defective unit and called support. The technician told me they did a remote check on my device, and it was working perfectly. So I have reconciled myself to having to put the device on the charger every night and sometimes more often. I didn't expect to be able to go six weeks without a charge as the ad claims because I read far more than a half hour daily (more like five or six hours) and have the light setting around 20 instead of 10. But even if my usage is a dozen times more than what the specs are based on, I shouldn't have to charge it more than a couple of times per week. And yes, I turn off wi-fi and go to airplane mode except when I'm downloading or moving books, and I still have to charge at least daily.The other annoyance is that I prefer my reading progress to show the reading time left in the book. However, it will randomly change from that (almost always when I change the orientation of the device and at other times I can't identify) to none or loc # or something else I don't want.However, while the two above items are disappointing and occasionally frustrating, I still love reading on the Oasis. My eyesight is very poor, but with a large font setting and bright light, I can read easily. I like being able to change the orientation of the device so the page turn buttons are where it's most comfortable, especially after I've been reading a while and want to change positions. I like all the other features that I've enjoyed in the various Kindles I've used through the years.I was an early adopter of ebooks, starting with the original Rocket eBook in 1999, the first electronic reading device, and going through a long line of devices before the Kindle was introduced. I've had most of the Kindles, and this is the best. I just wish it would hold a charge longer.
This is the best eReader that Amazon currently sells.That said, it's far from perfect.So let's talk about the good parts:1) The display is nice and large for my old eyes. My Paperwhite just doesn't display a lot of text when I make it big enough for me to read. The larger display on the new Oasis makes it possible for me to enlarge the text while still having nearly a full page of text on the screen.2) The Paperwhite's touch screen is very sluggish and its display is quite laggy. The Oasis is butter-smooth and quick.3) You're not going to fill up 8 gigs of memory with text eBooks. Don't bother getting the 32gb version unless you also intend to put a lot of Audible ebooks onto it.4) The backlighting is great. It's smooth and even across the screen.5) The page flip buttons are far more reliable when reading magazines than screen swipes are -- their magazine UI flips between stories sometimes when you're trying to screen swipe to the next page, having the buttons makes it much easier to read magazines.Now for the bad parts:1) Battery life SUCKS. Read one eBook, and half my battery is gone! My estimate is that this thing has roughly 1/4th the battery life of the Paperwhite.2) The general shape awkward. It isn't a rectangle (it's sort of stepped) so it doesn't lay flat on the table like the Paperwhite, and its width caused by that ridiculously enlarged bezel at one side makes it awkward to put into the pocket of a rain jacket. I would have preferred that they spread out the components behind the screen and had only a slightly enlarged bezel at the side for the page flip buttons, somewhat like the Voyager.In short, it's good, good enough for a four star rating -- but sorry, Amazon, you still didn't nail it. Give us more battery and a more regular shape, please?
The Kindle is convenient, but I am very disappointed in how often it needs charging, at least once a week, and I usually only read for about an hour a day.  That's FAR from the "months" you suggest in your ads. Still, it has prompted me to read authors I might never have tried and use our local library that I might have never visited.  In addition, as a older reader, I am now having difficulty reading, and the ability the Kindle gives me to increase the font size, increase the line spacing, and have a consistent light on the page makes reading both more comfortable and more pleasant than it has been for some time. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.
My previous Kindle was a Paperwhite, so my brain can't help but compare the two.  My thoughts:POSITIVE:> still smaller than most tablets, (smaller than my iPad mini) and still fits in my purse> Paperwhite screen -- so indoor/outdoor use as expected -- has setting for automatically dimming the screen if reading in a dark room.> buttons to turn page -- this allows for one-handed reading -- definitely a plus> screen flips so you can have button side on left or right making it easy to switch hands> still has touch screen -- allows for font size changing by two-finger "shrink" and "expand" motions> touch-screen page changing and getting to menu/optionsNEGATIVE:> BATTERY LIFE -- have to charge 3xs as often as my Kindle Paperwhite -- this is annoying -- and no charger other than a USB cord -- I guess they assume everyone has the plug converter ... really?  at this price??  come on Amazon!> touch screen -- it may be how I hold it occasionally, but it changes pages automatically.  I will be reading and all of the sudden it will go backwards 2-3 pages, on its own.  If it has water droplets on the screen it happens more often -- VERY ANNOYING!  Trying to read and relax in the hot tub and constantly having to re-find my page.  (I know, it's tough juggling a reader and a margarita glass -- 1st world problems.)> Reading Progress constantly goes back to "none" -- I'm consistently having to go back into settings and set it to what I like, "location in book".  Just checked it and it had self-changed to "Time left in chapter" which I never use.  I don't know why this setting doesn't keep.> overall, I do not regret getting this reader -- my older Kindle Paperwhite was slowing dying and this replaced it perfectly -- however for the price, it should not have the negatives I listed above.  This blew my husband's budget for my Christmas present this year -- I'm not sure it was worth being my only gift under the tree.  Kinda disappointing in that respect.
My Oasis just arrived today, so I'll have to update this review as I put more hours on it, but it's impressive so far.Pros:* Larger screen (so nice when my eyes are tired)* Nice, crisp display* Plays Audible books with Bluetooth headphones / earbuds* Waterproof (although I don't plan on testing this)Cons:* I wish the back of the thick part of the Oasis (left exposed by the cover) had some "grip" to it, the aluminum is pretty slick.  Apparently I need to buyone of these* Amazon and Audible web sites don't seem to support audio books on the new Oasis yet -- at least, I can't load audio books to the device from either of them (yet).  So I could preload the Kindle with eBooks before it arrived, but have to "pull" my Audible books to it from the device itself (annoying).
Got this for Christmas yesterday and so far I am really pleased. I started with the original Kindle, moved on to the Paperwhite and my awesome wife decided it was time for an upgrade I guess.The screen is truly impressive and the quality feel is definitely there. It feels like an expensive device and the aluminum back is a nice touch.My biggest beef with the Paperwhite was the slowwww software and lack of physical buttons. I have read nearly 500 books on it and would never say it is not a great device at its price point. Still, it could get frustrating using the store or doing anything other than reading. The Oasis 2 solves both of those issues for me. The buttons are really helpful and responsive. The software is incredibly snappy and just what I was looking for.Do you need an Oasis 2? Meh, probably not as the cheaper Kindles are very, very good at what they do. But, if you feel like upgrading or just treating yourself to something a little more, I highly recommend this Oasis 2.
The Oasis 2 could easily pass for Apple's next gen iPad mini,its that well done.  It is heavier and slightly harder to hold, especially reading in bed compared to the first gen Oasis but much easier than the Voyage due to a larger edge/bezel making for easier grasping.  The addition of physical page turn buttons make it easily superior as a reading device to the Voyage which had only price,battery life and the auto brightness sensor to recommend it over the much lighter Oasis 1(O1).  The Oasis 2(O2) battery is much larger than O1's and gives me about four times the reading time under the same use compared to the O1 without the battery/cover connected,and just about the same battery life as the Voyage(V). That bigger battery weighs in making the O2 much heavier than the O1 and even slightly heavier than the V.  That said the larger gripping surface of the latest model gives the O2 less perception of that extra weight. I found the rounded curve of the holding side/battery hump and the other (kinda)sharp edges actually aided in gripping compared to what it would have been if the back was absolutely flat. Amazon is on to a good thing with the asymmetric offset giving maximum gripping surface in the most compact design possible and I expect it to be copied by competitors over time. I will admit that a rubberized back would make it less likely to slide off of one's lap if you use it that way otherwise I had few problems.  For me the extra battery life is nice but what swung the deal was the larger screen size.  Over the years of using older Kindles I got used to that small reading screen and the O2 woke me up to what a hinderance this was.  I would expect more screen size increases across all models.  More screen takes more battery which means better battery tech or higher weight which may slow adoption. I admit the negligible weight of the O1 made it impressively easy to use with a plus that it was so light that it did not gain enough inertia on my numerous drops to damage it.  The V and the O2 both have the back of the device wrapping around the front with a very slight rise above the screen, not much but in my way to many drops of the V(I drop 'em all frequently and have never broken a Kindle screen-ever) this seems to be all the protection the V needed.  The slight increase in weight of the O2 over the V should make little difference in its drop proofing. With the screen lights turned off the O2 screen falls between the V(grayest) and the O1 in whiteness of the screen.  In practice with the O2 at my normal light setting screen whiteness and text crispness was to my eyes equal to or preferable to the O1. After the screen size increase the long overdue switch to a faster processor pulled me in.  I spend a lot of time editing my various collections and moving books around which was usually painfully slow with all my previous Kindles.  This was much improved with the O2,but some of that probably has to do with improvement in the O2's wifi capability.  I have no details from Amazon about this but real world experience downloading about 350 books while setting up the O2 showed total times cut roughly in half and hassles with force quitting and restarting when the process froze cut the frustration factor almost to zilch. For big library Kindle owners or those who read several hours a day the O2 will shine, for others-the Paperwhite is said to be superb at its price point. Fit,finish and overall quality are the best of any of the eight Kindles I have owned to date. I read somewhere between 1000 and 1500 hours a year on whatever my current Kindle is and finally, except for weight and the slick back, the O2 meets all my hopes.  I may even skip an upgrade next year.
I received the first version of the Kindle Oasis last year for Christmas.  Due to the magnets not being great on the cases, I had 2 fall out of the case while I was walking on concrete and the fall busted the screen both times.  This time, when I took the case back to the store where my husband bought it (he purchased it at an electronics store rather than Amazon so that he could use our credit card there and earn points), they advised me that the version I had was no longer available and I would have to buy the new one.  I pretended it was an inconvenience, but of course I was excited to try the new version!I have had my new Oasis now for about 3 days.  Overall, I am impressed with the performance over the 1st generation for several reasons, but there are a couple of issues as well.1) This version seems to operate quicker.  I'm not sure if they changed the internal chip set, but plan to look into that and may update this review with what I find....but it definitely "freezes" less than my old one did.  Keep in mind that when I say it freezes, that is mainly only when I am downloading.  I have over 1,000 kindle eBooks, so I basically am just downloading a group each day and using the download capability seems to use up a lot of the system memory used for operating the device.  Again, though, even this particular scenario still is a vast improvement over the prior version.2)  Everyone is mentioning how using the Audible feature runs down the battery.  This is true.  One other thing that runs the battery down quickly is downloading.  While this is to be expected, the lack of a battery case with the new version combined with these two battery draining issues made my kindle that was almost completely charged run down in a couple of days.3)  I certainly agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of the ability to listen to and read along with a book when you have the Audible and Kindle versions.  I love this feature on my phone app, and am hoping it will be migrated to the new Oasis with a system update in the near future.4)  I love that this is waterproof!  I set it next to the sink while doing dishes last night as I listened to an eBook with my Bluetooth headphones.  It wound up with some water on it, but I didn't have to worry about it.  It will be nice to be able to ready in a warm bath as well....plus I don't have to worry about my 7 year old daughter spilling something on it.5) I do not like that the new version of the Oasis does not come with a cover as the prior version did, and especially do not like the lack of an available battery case. Of course, with the lack of contacts for a battery case and the fact that wireless charging is not mentioned as a feature, I'm guessing this is not something that will be forthcoming.6)  The availability to read in any light is still one of the best features...and now being able to invert black and white is wonderful for night time reading.7)  I do wish it was USB-C, as I have very few devices left using the mini-USB so not many charging cable, but this is definitely not a deal breaker.8)  As someone who does not keep a lot of audio-books on a device at the same time, the 8 GB version is working out fine for me.  I had originally wanted the 32 GB but I tend to "clean out" the device now and then so removing the audio books when needed isn't a problem for me.  While a micro-SD slot might have been nice, I know that the more ports on a device, the harder it is to guarantee the waterproof feature.9)  I wish multiple books at a time could be selected for actions such as downloading or moving to a collection.10)  While I haven't tested it yet, I do like the idea of the new "Nightlight" feature, which claims to gradually dim the screen over time and your eyes adjust to the darkness.  I am assuming of course that this will only work when you have the auto brightness feature turned on.Overall, I am impressed with the new version of the Oasis.  While there are still a couple of updates that I believe could truly put this device over the top, I am certainly happy with my new Kindle.  Also, I will most likely update my rating to 5 stars if they update the audible/kindle read-along issue.
I'm enchanted with this Kindle. The screen is perfect for me. I didn't like the blindingly white screen on the Voyage. The softer cream tone much better easier on my eyes. The extra size of the screen is wonderful. The device is noticeably, impressively fast.I read with my Kindle in a case, but my case didnt come until I had this Oasis several days, It was comfortable to hold bare and didnt seem either too cold or too slippery.Cant hear the buttons, and I like them better than those on Oasis 2016 which always seemed too high.The auto light adjustment works, which it never did for me on the Voyage.The original partial charge already on the device when I got it did drain fast, but since then (after a restart and complete charge where it sat for a couple hours after 100% - recommended elsewhere), its doing fine compared to Voyage and Oasis 2016 with cover.Didnt buy Amazon cover because of reviews. Would like to find lighter 3d party cover than what Ive got.
I've never been too fan of e-books, always preferring the physical book. However, things do change and lately I've been increasingly buying e-books because of their instantaneous delivery. At first, when I had just a few of ebooks, I used the Mac Kindle app to read. However, as the number of e-books kept increasing, I started to ask myself if I should a Kindle instead.After some research and comparison between the different available models, I decided to buy the new Oasis mainly because of its increased memory size, its water proofing, smooth backlight and page keys.Since it's the first Kindle I've ever owned, I cannot compare to other models. However, I can tell that I'm more than happy with my purchase.Form factor: I'm not sure if I completely like the idea of the asymmetric form factor. I would probably have preferred a thicker device (i.e. about 5-7mm?) instead of a hump to one side. However this is just a personal preference and the form factor works ok for me as it is. I love having the page keys next to the screen. I use them all the time and I would really miss them if I didn't have them.Screen: the 7" display looks simply beautiful. It's very easy to read and has a very high contrast ratio even in direct sunlight. The very smooth backlight makes it ideal for reading with little to no external light. I've used the device at some caribbean beaches (very sunny!), at home and at an airplane (with cabin light off and no reading light) with no issues.Battery life: with the default configuration, battery life was surprisingly short: I went through a full charge in about 2 days without much reading. After I reduced the backlight (which was too bright by default anyway), things improved quite a bit and now I'm getting about 5-6 days with some serious reading time (2-3 hours daily). Keep in mind that this is with cellular connectivity enabled. I'm sure thing would improve further if I enable airplane mode. Guess I expected a bit more, but it's good enough for me.Cellular connectivity: I wanted specifically this version since I don't always have wifi available (for example, I cannot use it with the office's wifi). I'm happy to say that it lives up to the expectation.Misc: the build quality seems excellent. No signs of sharp edges, as reported by other reviews. The aluminum casing is not too cold for me, but I guess that in a colder weather it may get too cold. Anyway, I put a Moko case to it. I can't understand why they don't include an AC adaptor with this device. I mean, after paying about $350, I still have to shell a few bucks more for a charger?Overall: I highly recommend this reader. The reading experience is simply wonderful and simple.
This is a really nice Kindle. I like the feel and ease of it. Have had most of the kindle models since the first one came out and I think this is the best to date. It is lightweight, small and a joy to use. Soooo much lighter than holding my, up to now, primary reader the ipad mini 4. Also much less eye strain which is nice since I read hours at a time (seriously Amazon who reads for 30 minutes a day.....)  Reminds me of the very first kindle with the way it feels holding it. Like how the one edge is wider making it easy to hold and not worry about where your fingers are which was one thing I haven't been impressed with on other kindles.  I did put a lazy hand 4 finger grip on it which makes it even more ideal for holding more securely and is easier on my old finger joints.  Put it in the center behind the buttons so it works great regardless of which hand I hold it in.  The only major complaint I have is that my collections are not in order like they were on my ipad app. Not sure if that is kindle hiccup or operator hiccup. Also it doesn't seem to allow you to work with your collections like you can on the ipad app. The other negatives are the case, it keeps falling off so I took it off  and it seems like the edges where the screen meets the metal casing feel rough rather than smooth. So I find this kindle to be worth it and yes I got the 32gb because I like having a lot books downloaded and glad they finally got beyond the 4/8gb stage.
